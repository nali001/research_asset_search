can see from the feature importance graph that, the caa feature is having more influence in the output column followed by cp and slp, sex and thalachh features. Even old peak,thall, age,restecg, exng seems to have some effect on Output. The trtbps and chol are not influencing the output feature much. \n\nWe saw from bivariate that when the number of major vessels(caa value) is too small and when too large it was having more chances of getting heart attack. Also the chest pain type is having high influence on Output, so whether the person will get heart attack or not is mainly determined by the number of major vessels and the type of chest pain that person gets.\n\nThe slp value is also having very high influence and an interesting feature is the sex feature, where we saw from bivariate analysis that the gender type 1 is specifically having more chances of getting heart attack.\n\nThe normal heart rate is also influencing very much, we saw that when that person is having higher heart rate then that person has more chances of getting heart attack and we also saw that when the heart rate is very less, then that person does not have a chance of getting heart attack at all.\n\nSo, any health industry should focus on these 4 features to determine if the person will get heart attack or not.","metadata":{}}]}
