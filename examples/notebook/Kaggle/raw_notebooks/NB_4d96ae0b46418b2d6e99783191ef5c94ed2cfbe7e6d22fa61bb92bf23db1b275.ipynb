, by refering back to the code book and the decision tree algorithm text above , we can say that :\n1/most of the who are having problem sleeping are having problem staying sleep when the fall sleep.\n2/Hours sleeping which is less than 7.25 hours per night during weekends affects the quality of sleep in the other weekdays and the general value of sleep.\n3/healthrate is another factor which affect sleep quality , people who responses less than 7 on health rate scale reported problems with sleep quality.\n4/people who responed with higher than 7 on stress per month factor reported lower sleep quality , so stress levels are influencing sleep ratings.\n5/finally and with less influence but also used, people who had fatigue were also having sleep problems.","metadata":{}}]}
