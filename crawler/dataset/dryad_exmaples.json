A higher resolution image of these systems shows that the connection types do not confine to one but to a variety of types. Multiplex networks encode this complexity with a set of nodes which are connected in different layers via different types of links.\nA large body of research on link prediction problem is devoted to finding missing links in single-layer (simplex) networks. In recent years, the problem of link prediction in multiplex networks has gained the attention of researchers from different scientific communities. Although most of these studies suggest that prediction performance can be enhanced by using the information contained in different layers of the network, the exact source of this enhancement remains obscure.\nHere, it is shown that similarity w.r.t. structural features (eigenvectors) is a major source of enhancements for link prediction task in multiplex networks using the proposed Layer Reconstruction Method and experiments on real-world multiplex networks from different disciplines. Moreover, we characterize how low values of similarity w.r.t. structural features result in cases where improving prediction performance is substantially hard.",

          "abstract": "As carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) levels increase, coral reefs and other marine systems will be affected by the joint stressors of ocean acidification (OA) and warming. The effects of these two stressors on coral physiology are relatively well studied, but their impact on biotic interactions between corals are poorly understood. While coral-coral interactions are less common on modern reefs, it is important to document the nature of these interactions to better inform restoration strategies in the face of climate change. Using a mesocosm study, we evaluated whether the combined effects of ocean acidification and warming alter the competitive interactions between the common coral  Porites astreoides  and two other mounding corals (  Montastraea cavernosa  or  Orbicella faveolata  ) common in the Caribbean. After 7 days of direct contact,  P. astreoides  suppressed the photosynthetic potential of  M. cavernosa  by 100% in areas of contact under both present (~28.5°C and ~400 μatm  p  CO  2  ) and predicted future (~30.0°C and ~1000 μatm  p  CO  2  ) conditions. In contrast, under present conditions  M. cavernosa  reduced the photosynthetic potential of  P. astreoides  by only 38% in areas of contact, while under future conditions reduction was 100%.  A similar pattern occurred between  P. astreoides  and  O. faveolata  at day 7 post contact, but by day 14, each coral had reduced the photosynthetic potential of the other by 100% at the point of contact, and  O. faveolata  was generating larger lesions on  P. astreoides  than the reverse.  In the absence of competition, OA and warming did not affect the photosynthetic potential of any coral. These results suggest that OA and warming can alter the severity of initial coral-coral interactions, with potential cascading effects due to corals serving as foundation species on coral reefs.",

          "abstract": "1. Robust predictions of predator-prey interactions are fundamental for the understanding of food webs, their structure, dynamics, resistance to species loss, response to invasions and ecosystem function. Most current food web models measure parameters at the food web level to predict patterns at the same level. Thus, they are sensitive to the quality of the data, and may be ineffective in predicting non-observed interactions and disturbed food webs. There is a need for mechanistic models that predict the occurrence of a predator-prey interaction based on lower levels of organization (i.e., the traits of organisms) and the properties of their environment. 2. Here, we present such a model that focuses on the predation act itself. We built a Newtonian, mechanical model for the processes of searching, capturing and handling of a prey item by a predator. Associated with general metabolic laws, we predict the net energy gain from predation for pairs of pelagic or flying predator species and their prey depending on their body sizes. 3. Predicted interactions match well with data from the most extensive predator-prey database, and overall model accuracy is greater than the allometric niche model. 4. Our model shows that it is possible to accurately predict the structure of food webs using only a few mechanical traits. It underlines the importance of physical constraints in structuring food webs.",

          "abstract": "Wild quantitative genetic studies have focused on a subset of traits (largely morphological and life-history), with others, such as behaviors, receiving much less attention. This is because it is challenging to obtain sufficient data, particularly for behaviors involving interactions between individuals. Here, we explore an indirect approach for pilot investigations of the role of genetic differences in generating variation in parental care. Variation in parental genetic effects for offspring performance is expected to arise from among-parent genetic variation in parental care. Therefore, we used the animal model to predict maternal breeding values for lamb growth and used these predictions to select females for field observation, where maternal and lamb behaviors were recorded. Higher predicted maternal breeding value for lamb growth was associated with greater suckling success, but not with any other measures of suckling behavior. Though our work cannot explicitly estimate the genetic basis of the specific traits involved, it does provide a strategy for hypothesis generation and refinement, that we hope could be used to justify data collection costs needed for confirmatory studies. Here results suggest that behavioral genetic variation is involved in generating maternal genetic effects on lamb growth in Soay sheep. Though important caveats and cautions apply, our approach may extend the ability to initiate more genetic investigations of difficult-to-study behaviours and social interactions in natural populations.",

          "abstract": "<p>In variable environments, phenotypic plasticity can increase fitness by providing tight environment-phenotype matching. However, adaptive plasticity is expected to evolve only when the future selective environment can be predicted based on the prevailing conditions. That is, the juvenile environment should be predictive of the adult environment (within-generation plasticity) or the parental environment should be predictive of the offspring environment (transgenerational plasticity). Moreover, environmental predictability can also shape transient responses such as stress responses in an adaptive direction. Here, we test links between environmental predictability and the evolution of adaptive plasticity by combining time series analyses and a common garden experiment using temperature as a stressor in a temperate butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Time series analyses revealed that across-season fluctuations in temperature over 48 years are overall predictable. However, within the growing season, temperature fluctuations showed high heterogeneity across years with low autocorrelations and the timing of temperature peaks was asynchronous. Most life-history traits showed strong within-generation plasticity for temperature and traits such as body size and growth rate broke the temperature-size rule. Evidence for transgenerational plasticity, however, was weak and detected for only two traits each in an adaptive and non-adaptive direction. We suggest that the low predictability of temperature fluctuations within the growing season likely disfavours the evolution of adaptive transgenerational plasticity but instead favours strong within-generation plasticity.</p>",

          "abstract": "Predicting functions of proteins and alternatively spliced isoforms encoded in a genome is one of the important applications of bioinformatics in the post-genome era. Due to the practical limitation of experimental characterization of all proteins encoded in a genome using biochemical studies, bioinformatics methods provide powerful tools for function annotation and prediction. These methods also help minimize the growing sequence-to-function gap. Phylogenetic profiling is a bioinformatics approach to identify the influence of a trait across species and can be employed to infer the evolutionary history of proteins encoded in genomes. Here we propose an improved phylogenetic profile-based method which considers the co-evolution of the reference genome to derive the basic similarity measure, the background phylogeny of target genomes for profile generation and assigning weights to target genomes. The ordering of genomes and the runs of consecutive matches between the proteins were used to define phylogenetic relationships in the approach. We used Escherichia coli K12 genome as the reference genome and its 4195 proteins were used in the current analysis. We compared our approach with two existing methods and our initial results show that the predictions have outperformed two of the existing approaches. In addition, we have validated our method using a targeted protein-protein interaction network derived from protein-protein interaction database STRING. Our preliminary results indicates that improvement in function prediction can be attained by using coevolution-based similarity measures and the runs on to the same scale instead of computing them in different scales. Our method can be applied at the whole-genome level for annotating hypothetical proteins from prokaryotic genomes.",

          "abstract": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Flowers have evolved remarkable diversity in petal color, in large part due to pollinator-mediated selection. This diversity arises from specialized metabolic pathways that generate conspicuous pigments. Despite the clear link between flower color and floral pigment production, studies determining predictive relationships between pigmentation and petal color are currently lacking. In this study, we analyze a dataset consisting of hundreds of natural <em>Penstemon</em> hybrids that exhibit variation in flower color, including blue, purple, pink, and red. For each individual hybrid, we measured anthocyanin pigment content and petal spectral reflectance. We found that floral pigment quantities are correlated with hue, chroma, and brightness as calculated from petal spectral reflectance data: hue is related to the relative amounts of delphinidin vs. pelargonidin pigmentation, whereas brightness and chroma are correlated with the total anthocyanin pigmentation. We used a partial least squares regression approach to identify predictive relationships between pigment production and petal reflectance. We find that pigment quantity data provide robust predictions of petal reflectance, confirming a pervasive assumption that differences in pigmentation should predictably influence flower color. Moreover, we find that reflectance data enables accurate inferences of pigment quantities, where the full reflectance spectra provide much more accurate inference of pigment quantities than spectral attributes (brightness, chroma, and hue). Our predictive framework provides readily interpretable model coefficients relating spectral attributes of petal reflectance to underlying pigment quantities. These relationships represent key links between genetic changes affecting anthocyanin production and ecological functions of petal coloration.</p>",

          "abstract": "Colonial breeding is an evolutionary puzzle, as the benefits of breeding in high densities are still not fully explained. Although the dynamics of existing colonies are increasingly understood, few studies have addressed the initial formation of colonies, and empirical tests are rare. Using a high-resolution larval drift model, we here document that the distribution of seabird colonies along the Norwegian coast can be explained by variations in the availability and predictability of fish larvae. The modelled variability in concentration of fish larvae is, in turn, predicted by the topography of the continental shelf and coastline. The advection of fish larvae along the coast translates small-scale topographic characteristics into a macroecological pattern, viz. the spatial distribution of top-predator breeding sites. Our findings provide empirical corroboration of the hypothesis that seabird colonies are founded in locations that minimise travel distances between breeding and foraging locations, thereby enabling optimal foraging by central-place foragers.",

          "abstract": "Public goods cooperation is common in microbes, and there is much interest in understanding how such traits evolve. Research in recent years has identified several important factors that shape the evolutionary dynamics of such systems, yet few studies have investigated scenarios involving interactions between multiple public goods. Here we offer general predictions about the evolutionary trajectories of two public goods traits having positive, negative or neutral regulatory influence on one another's expression, and we report on a test of some of our predictions in the context of Pseudomonas aeruginosa's production of two interlinked iron-scavenging siderophores. First, we confirmed that both pyoverdine and pyochelin siderophores do operate as public goods under appropriate environmental conditions. We then tracked their production in lines experimentally evolved under different iron-limitation regimes known to favour different siderophore expression profiles. Under strong iron limitation, where pyoverdine represses pyochelin, we saw a decline in pyoverdine and a concomitant increase in pyochelin – consistent with expansion of pyoverdine-defective cheats derepressed for pyochelin. Under moderate iron limitation, pyochelin declined – again consistent with an expected cheat invasion scenario – but there was no concomitant shift in pyoverdine because cross-suppression between the traits is unidirectional only. Alternating exposure to strong and moderate iron-limitation caused qualitatively similar though lesser shifts compared to the constant-environment regimes. Our results confirm that the regulatory inter-connections between public goods traits can significantly modulate the course of evolution, yet also suggest how we can start to predict the impacts such complexities will have on phenotypic divergence and community stability.",

          "abstract": "<p>Extra-organismal DNA (eoDNA) from material left behind by organisms (non-invasive DNA: e.g., faeces, hair) or from environmental samples (eDNA: e.g., water, soil) is a valuable source of genetic information. However, the relatively low quality and quantity of eoDNA, which can be further degraded by environmental factors, results in reduced amplification and sequencing success. This is often compensated for through cost- and time-intensive replications of genotyping/sequencing procedures. Therefore, system- and site-specific quantifications of environmental degradation are needed to maximize sampling efficiency (e.g., fewer replicates, shorter sampling durations), and to improve species detection and abundance estimates. Using ten environmentally diverse bat roosts as a case study, we developed a robust modelling pipeline to quantify the environmental factors degrading eoDNA, predict eoDNA quality, and estimate sampling-site-specific ideal exposure duration. Maximum humidity was the strongest eoDNA-degrading factor, followed by exposure duration and then maximum temperature. We also found a positive effect when hottest days occurred later. The strength of this effect fell between the strength of the effects of exposure duration and maximum temperature. With those predictors and information on sampling period (before or after offspring were born), we reliably predicted mean eoDNA quality per sampling visit at new sites with a mean squared error of 0.0349. Site-specific simulations revealed that reducing exposure duration to 2-8 days could substantially improve eoDNA quality for future sampling. Our pipeline identified high humidity and temperature as strong drivers of eoDNA degradation even in the absence of rain and direct sunlight. Furthermore, we outline the pipeline’s utility for other systems and study goals, such as estimating sample age, improving eDNA-based species detection, and increasing the accuracy of abundance estimates.</p>",

We sampled each roost twice a year: once in June and once in August, i.e., before and after offspring were born. We spread sheets of newspaper under the main hanging sites, and returned after 9-13 days to collect newly deposited droppings (Puechmaille &amp; Petit, 2007). Here, we refer to such a sampling event of 9-13 days within a roost as a “roost-visit” (RV). We only retained the 25 RVs where both roost temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%, hereafter “humidity”) were recorded with iButtons (Maxim Integrated Products, 2015 ) logging every 30 to 180 minutes inside the roost. The microclimate of the roosts varied greatly, including hot and dry attics, cold and humid cellars, and natural semi-open caves. We excluded temperature and humidity measures from the first (newspaper deployment) and the last (sample collection) day, because exact deployment and collection times were not always recorded. We stored all droppings of each RV separately in airtight plastic boxes with silica-gel-beads to dry the droppings immediately upon collection (Lehnen et al., 2018). Boxes with samples were kept at room temperature for 1 to 20 days after collection, and subsequently stored at -20°C prior to extraction to achieve optimal cold and dry storage conditions (Wasser et al., 1997).</p>\n<p><strong>DNA extraction and genotyping</strong></p>\n<p>Following Jan et al. (2019), for the June and August sampling, respectively, we randomly picked 1.1 and 2.1 times as many droppings from the plastic boxes as adults counted in June. To reduce potential contamination, we picked droppings and extracted their DNA at two designated benches in a pre-PCR laboratory (i.e. no PCR products are allowed in the lab) dedicated to <em>Rhinolophus hipposideros</em> non-invasive genetics. We amplified eight microsatellite loci and a sex marker from the extracts in one multiplex, and scored and genotyped them following established lab protocols (Zarzoso-Lacoste et al., 2018; Zarzoso-Lacoste et al., 2020). To minimize single-well pipetting errors, we used a multichannel pipette, working strip-wise (8 wells) on 96-well plates. For microsatellite amplification, we loaded three replicates of each sample from the 96-well extraction plates onto three different 384-well PCR plates with a pipetting robot, so that every 384-well PCR plate contained one replicate of a total of four 96-well extraction plates. All further processing was robot-assisted, thereby minimizing well-wise laboratory effects.</p>\n<p>We used a multi-tube approach with three replicates to form reliable consensus genotypes. This replicate number is based on Puechmaille et al. (2007) where an average of 2.73 replicates (2.54-3.09, depending on colony) resulted in reliable consensus genotypes for the same species and collection protocol. To be included in a consensus genotype, an allele at a locus had to be present at least twice across the replicates (i.e., two or three out of three). We automated this process using the bioinformatics pipeline described in Zarzoso-Lacoste et al. (2018) and applied by Jan et al. (2019). This pipeline recovers weaker peaks within a replicate due to hierarchical fall back from more stringent peak detection thresholds, while reducing scoring alleles from cross-contamination by combining peak height thresholds, peak height ratios and a multi-tube approach (Mäck et al., 2021). If more than two alleles were detected at a locus in a replicate, only the highest two were kept, while lower ones, potentially introduced by cross-contamination, were discarded. To avoid scoring a true homozygote locus as a heterozygote locus, second-highest alleles were only accepted at a locus of a replicate if they exceeded a certain height peak ratio compared to the higher peak (see further details in Zarzoso-Lacoste et al., 2018; Jan et al. 2019).</p>\n<p>To facilitate comparison to other eoDNA degradation studies, we calculated the commonly used PCR success rate per sample, defined as the proportion of all loci across all replicates that resulted in a scorable peak. However, to measure actual eoDNA degradation, we used the three replicates and the consensus to calculated the more informative quality index (QI) per sample, a measure of locus-wise agreement of single replicates to their consensus genotype (Miquel et al., 2006). QI can range from zero (indicating amplification failure and/or complete inter-replicate disagreement) to one (amplification and agreement of all three replicates with the consensus). If no consensus could be built due to complete failure of amplification in all replicates of that locus, or due to the inability to form an allele-wise majority, the consensus at that locus was scored as NA and the QI as 0.</p>\n<p>In the calculation of QI, we deviated from the pipeline of Zarzoso-Lacoste et al. (2018) in two important steps. First, we kept all multi-locus genotypes (MLGs), irrespective of the number of loci with a consensus, to explore the full spectrum of eoDNA degradation in our samples. Second, we skipped the step of manually checking (and eventually correcting) every consensus genotype that differed from others by one or two loci (Puechmaille &amp; Petit, 2007), because we were only interested in measuring eoDNA degradation. Lower QI prior to the manual correction due to disagreement among loci between replicates or inability to form a consensus at a locus can inform about potential degradation of eoDNA (see Supp_01), and manual correction would likely weaken such signal. Compared to a manually corrected dataset, only 8.83% of usable samples (&gt; seven consensus loci) in this study would be corrected with a majority (91.7%) being altered at only one consensus locus leading to a theoretical maximum QI deviation of 0.11 - 0.13 in the few samples distributed over the RVs (Supp_02). We also removed one locus (RHC108) in 2018 because its consistently low peak height and amplification failure indicated a lab error for that marker in that year (Supp_03).</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering and statistical analyses as additional description not mentioned in the publication</strong></p>\n<p>The data table (\"quality_condition_tablemaxH100_nocoords.RData\") in the folder \"data\" in the provided zip file contains information about what happened with droppings from spreading newspaper to collection up to genotyping and is measured on the decrease of the Quality Index (QI). The table contains collection site (\"Roost\"), year,(\"Year\") sampling session (June=1 or August=2)(\"Sess\") plate, lane and well information about extraction and PCR, logged temperature and humidity and the proximity of the logger to the samples (Droppings) as well as the exposure duration (\"Days\") until collection. The location on the extraction plate is also used as unique identifier for every sample (“Dropping”) analysed. All further filtering and data preparation and statistical analyses of the publication, including figures, are created with this R Script based on this table. This also allows to replace the table with own data to easily apply the pipeline to other systems. Note that the logger data was trimmed before adding it to the table to exclude the distribution and collection date. This was necessary because the exact time of the day of distributing newspaper under the hanging sites and the collection of the droppings was not always protocolled and temperature and humidity readings on these days could have been altered.

          "abstract": "Understanding the distribution of crossovers along chromosomes is crucial to evolutionary genomics because the crossover rate determines how strongly a genome region is influenced by natural selection. Nevertheless, generalities in the chromosome-scale distribution of crossovers have not been investigated formally. We fill this gap by synthesizing joint information on genetic and physical maps across 62 animal, plant, and fungal species. Our quantitative analysis reveals a strong and taxonomically wide-spread reduction of the crossover rate in the center of chromosomes relative to their peripheries. We demonstrate that this pattern is poorly explained by the position of the centromere, but find that the magnitude of the relative reduction in the crossover rate in chromosome centers increases with chromosome length. That is, long chromosomes often display a dramatically low crossover rate in their center whereas short chromosomes exhibit a relatively homogeneous crossover rate. This observation is compatible with a model in which crossovers are initiated from the chromosome tips, an idea with preliminary support from mechanistic investigations of meiotic recombination. Consequently, we show that organisms achieve a higher genome-wide crossover rate by evolving smaller chromosomes. Summarizing theory and providing empirical examples, we finally highlight that taxonomically wide-spread and systematic heterogeneity in crossover rate along chromosomes generates predictable broad-scale trends in genetic diversity and population differentiation by modifying the impact of natural selection among regions within a genome. We conclude by emphasizing that chromosome-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate should urgently be incorporated into analytical tools in evolutionary genomics, and in the interpretation of emerging patterns.",

          "abstract": "Speciation genomic studies aim to interpret patterns of genome-wide variation in light of the processes that give rise to new species. However, interpreting the genomic ‘landscape’ of speciation is difficult, because many evolutionary processes can impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first chromosome-level assembly for the group, we use whole-genome sequencing and simulations to shed light on the processes that have shaped the genomic landscape during a radiation of monkeyflowers. After inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the nine taxa in this radiation, we show that highly similar diversity (π) and differentiation (FST) landscapes have emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was strongly predicted by the local density of functional elements and the recombination rate, suggesting that the landscapes have been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the varying divergence times between pairs of taxa, we show that the correlations between FST and genome features arose almost immediately after a population split and have become stronger over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest that background selection (i.e., selection against deleterious mutations) alone is too subtle to generate the observed patterns, but scenarios that involve positive selection and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative explanations. Finally, tests for introgression among these taxa reveal widespread evidence of heterogeneous selection against gene flow during this radiation. Combined with previous evidence for adaptation in this system, we conclude that the correlation in FST among these taxa informs us about the processes contributing to adaptation and speciation during a rapid radiation.",

          "abstract": "Glucocorticoids, including corticosterone (CORT), have been suggested to provide a physiological link between ecological conditions and fitness. Specifically, CORT, which is elevated in response to harsh conditions, is predicted to be correlated with reduced fitness. Yet, empirical studies show that CORT can be non-significantly, positively and negatively linked with fitness. Divergent environmental conditions between years or study systems may influence whether CORT is linked to fitness. To test this, we monitored free-living blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) during breeding over 3 years. We quantified foraging conditions during brood rearing, and examined whether they were correlated with parental baseline CORT and reproductive success. We then tested whether CORT predicted fitness. Elevated parental CORT was associated with lower temperatures, greater rainfall and lower territory-scale oak density. Whereas asynchrony with the caterpillar food peak was correlated with reduced nestling mass and fledging success, but not parental CORT. Only low temperatures were associated with both reduced nestling mass and elevated parental CORT. Despite this, parents with elevated CORT had lighter offspring in all years. Contrarily, in 2009 parental CORT was positively correlated with the number fledged. The absence of a direct link between the foraging conditions that reduce nestling quality and elevate parental CORT suggests that parental CORT may provide a holistic measure of conditions where parents are working harder to meet the demands of developing young. As the positive correlation between parental CORT and fledging success differed between years, this suggests that contrasting conditions between years can influence correlations between parental CORT and fitness. Ultimately, as CORT concentrations are intrinsically variable and linked to the prevalent conditions, studies that incorporate environmental harshness will improve our understanding of evolutionary endocrinology.",

          "abstract": "A plant's growth rate is seen as a central element of its ecological strategy, and as determined by its traits.Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate. We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work, and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies (> 500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate).We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature.To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling,sapling and adult. Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages.Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants.Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings,seedlings and adults,respectively. Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions,major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature.For example,for one third of the traits considered,the majority (> 75%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage. Synthesis: We show for some traits, how trait-growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size.Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Genetic introgression from a resident species into an invading close relative can result from repeated hybridisation along the invasion front and/or allele surfing on the expansion wave. Cases where the phenomenon is massive and systematic, such as for hares (genus Lepus) in Iberia, would be best explained by recurrent hybridisation but this is difficult to prove since the donor populations are generally extinct. In the Pyrenean foothills, Lepus europaeus presumably replaced Lepus granatensis recently and the present species border is parallel to the direction of invasion, so that populations of L. granatensis in the contact zone represent proxies of existing variation before the invasion. Among three pairs of populations sampled across this border, we find less differentiation of mtDNA across than along it, as predicted under recurrent hybridisation at the invasion front. Using autosomal microsatellite loci and X and Y-linked diagnostic loci, we show that admixture across the border is quasi-absent, making it unlikely that lack of interspecific mtDNA differentiation result from ongoing gene flow. Furthermore, we find that the local species ranges are climatically contrasted, making it also unlikely that ongoing ecology-driven movement of the contact account for mtDNA introgression. The lack of mtDNA differentiation across the boundary is mostly due to sharing of mtDNA from a boreal species currently extinct in Iberia (Lepus timidus) whose mitochondria have thus remained in place since the last deglaciation despite successive invasions by two other species. Home loving mitochondria thus witness past species distribution rather than ongoing exchanges across stabilised contact zones.",

Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture. The matching term quantifies the assortative structure in which node makes links with which other node, while the centrality term quantifies the number of links that nodes make. We show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteris- tics are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it offers a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics ex- plain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node would create if it were to join an existing network.",

          "abstract": "1.Intraspecific trait change, including altered behaviour or morphology, can drive temporal variation in inter-specific interactions and population dynamics. In turn, variation in species’ interactions and densities can alter the strength and direction of trait change. The resulting feedback between species′ traits and abundance permits a wide range of community dynamics that would not be expected from ecological theories purely based on species abundances. Despite the theoretical importance of these interrelated processes, unambiguous experimental evidence of how intraspecific trait variation modifies species interactions and population dynamics and how this feeds back to influence trait variation is currently required.\r\n\r\n2.We investigate the role of trait-mediated demography in determining community dynamics and examine how ecological interactions influence trait change. We concurrently monitored the dynamics of community abundances and individual traits in an experimental microbial predator-prey-resource system. Using this data, we parameterized a trait dependent community model to identify key ecologically relevant traits and to link trait dynamics with those of species abundances.\r\n\r\n3.Our results provide clear evidence of a feedback between trait change, demographic rates and species dynamics. The inclusion of trait-abundance feedbacks into our population model improved the predictability of ecological dynamics from r-squared of 34% to 57% and confirmed theoretical expectations of density dependent population growth and species interactions in the system.\r\n\r\n4.Additionally, our model revealed that the feedbacks were underpinned by a trade-off between population growth and anti-predatory defence. High predator abundance was linked to a reduction in prey body size. This prey size decrease was associated with a reduction in its rate of consumption by predators and a decrease in its resource consumption.\r\n\r\n5.Modelling trait-abundance feedbacks allowed us to pinpoint the underlying life history trade-off which links trait and abundance dynamics. These results show that accounting for trait-abundance feedbacks has the potential to improve understanding and predictability of ecological dynamics.",

          "abstract": "1.Functional diversity (FD) metrics are widely used to assess invasion ecosystem impacts, but we have limited theory to predict how FD should respond to invasion. A key challenge to effectively using FD metrics is the complexity of conceptualizing alterations to multi-dimensional trait space, making it difficult to select a priori the most appropriate metric for specific ecological questions.\r\n\r\n2.Here, we provide expectations on how invasion should change four commonly used FD metrics—functional richness (FRic), evenness (FEve), divergence (FDiv), and dispersion (FDis)—and then test these expectations in a lab decomposition experiment. We simulate invasion of a forest by understory plants by adding leaf litter from 18 natives and nonnatives to a representative canopy tree litter mixture to test changes in FD and decomposition.\r\n\r\n3.All four metrics changed predictably with invasion. Species that were more functionally unique or when added at greater proportions had larger impacts on FD. Overall, FRic, FEve, and FDiv were poor choices for understanding impacts of nonnative species. FDis was the only metric that both changed predictably with addition of understory litter and correlated intuitively with changes in carbon mineralization. Furthermore, ranking species based upon how much they changed FDis of the litter mixture provided a fair assessment of which species had the largest impact on decomposition. As such, functional dispersion may be a key tool for predicting a priori which nonnatives will have the greatest impact on ecosystem processes.\r\n\r\n4.Synthesis: We highlight the need to assess the suitability of each FD metric for the specific ecological question at hand. Our work reveals the pitfalls of considering multiple metrics or randomly choosing a single metric without suitability assessments. At the same time, it suggests a framework for metric assessment that should help lead to selection of a metric or metrics that provide robust a priori insights into how invasion by nonnative species can impact ecosystem processes.",

Journal of Ecology.                           DATA SET 1: Brief Methods (for full methods see Kuebbing et al. 2017, Journal of Ecology). We used laboratory microcosm experiments to assess litter decomposition dynamics of litter mixtures. Each microcosm consisted of 1 g of 2 mm-milled leaf litter and 0.25 g of mineral soil in 50-mL centrifuge tubes. Each microcosm contained in equal proportion litter from each of the three dominant canopy trees (Carya cordiformis, Quercus alba, and Q. rubra), in addition to one of the 18 understory plants. The latter were added at three relative abundances (1%, 5%, and 25%). There were 216 microcosms (18 understory plants × 3 proportions [1%, 5%, and 25%] × 4 replicates) and 4 tree-canopy litter control replicates, bringing the total number of microcosms to 220. DATA SET 2: Brief Methods (for full methods see Kuebbing et al. 2017, Journal of Ecology). To assess green leaf traits, we collected 5 green leaves from a minimum of 5 individuals per species in summer 2014. For canopy trees, we “sling-shot sampled” canopy branches to collect full-sun leaves. For understory species, we randomly sampled leaves from individuals. We selected leaves that appeared free of herbivory as well as fungal or bacterial infection. We scanned fully-hydrated leaves on a flatbed scanner within 24 h of collection and then dried them at 60°C for 72 h before measuring mass. To estimate specific leaf area, we measured scanned leaf surface area with digital software (ImageJ v.1.51f) and divided area by dry mass. To assess the green leaf chemical traits, we ball milled the material (Spex CertiPrep 8000-D Mixer Mill, Metuchen, New Jersey, USA) and determined C and N concentrations using Micro-Dumas combustion analysis. To assess leaf litter traits, we collected litter in fall 2014 from senescing plants. We collected freshly-fallen leaves from the ground or shook senesced leaves free from branches. Litter was air-dried and leaves were selected that had no evidence of fungal colonization or herbivory. We milled all litter to pass a 2-mm mesh (Wiley® Cutting Mill, Model 2, Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA), creating a consistent size class across species (Strickland et al. 2009; Keiser et al. 2011; 2013). We used the same method as for green leaves to determine litter total N and C. To assess litter P we used acid digestion and colorimetric analysis of milled litter. To measure lignin we used the ANKOM acid detergent lignin method (ANKOM Technology, Macedon NY; protocol at www.ankom.com). We report total C, N and P on a percent mass basis and acid detergent lignin (ADL) on a per gram dry mass basis.</div><div class=\"o-metadata__file-name\">Kuebbing, Sara_Data for Dryad.xlsx</br></div></div>",

          "abstract": "Background:  Sexual dichromatism is the tendency for sexes to differ in color pattern and represents a striking form of within-species morphological variation. Conspicuous intersexual differences in avian plumage are generally thought to result from Darwinian sexual selection, to the extent that dichromatism is often treated as a surrogate for the intensity of sexual selection in phylogenetic comparative studies. Intense sexual selection is predicted to leave a footprint on genetic evolution by reducing the relative genetic diversity on sex chromosome to that on the autosomes.  Results:  In this study, we test the association between plumage dichromatism and sex-linked genetic diversity using eight species pairs with contrasting levels of dichromatism. We estimated Z-linked and autosomal genetic diversity for these non-model avian species using restriction-site associated (RAD) loci that covered ~3 % of the genome. We find that monochromatic birds consistently have reduced sex-linked genomic variation relative to phylogenetically-paired dichromatic species and this pattern is robust to mutational biases.  Conclusions:  Our results are consistent with several interpretations. If present-day sexual selection is stronger in dichromatic birds, our results suggest that its impact on sex-linked genomic variation is offset by other processes that lead to proportionately lower Z-linked variation in monochromatic species. We discuss possible factors that may contribute to this discrepancy between phenotypes and genomic variation. Conversely, it is possible that present-day sexual selection -- as measured by the variance in male reproductive success -- is stronger in the set of monochromatic taxa we have examined, potentially reflecting the importance of song, behavior and other non-plumage associated traits as targets of sexual selection. This counterintuitive finding suggests that the relationship between genomic variation and sexual selection is complex and highlights the need for a more comprehensive survey of genomic variation in avian taxa that vary markedly in social and genetic mating systems.",

          "abstract": "Closely related species may show similar levels of genetic diversity in homologous regions of the genome owing to shared ancestral variation still segregating in the extant species. However, after completion of lineage sorting, such covariation is not necessarily expected. On the other hand, if the processes that govern genetic diversity are conserved, diversity may potentially covary even among distantly related species. We mapped regions of conserved synteny between the genomes of two divergent bird species—collared flycatcher and hooded crow—and identified more than 600 Mb of homologous regions (66% of the genome). From analyses of whole-genome resequencing data in large population samples of both species we found nucleotide diversity in 200 kb windows to be well correlated (Spearman's ρ = 0.407). The correlation remained highly similar after excluding coding sequences. To explain this covariation, we suggest that a stable avian karyotype and a conserved landscape of recombination rate variation render the diversity-reducing effects of linked selection similar in divergent bird lineages. Principal component regression analysis of several potential explanatory variables driving heterogeneity in flycatcher diversity levels revealed the strongest effects from recombination rate variation and density of coding sequence targets for selection, consistent with linked selection. It is also possible that a stable karyotype is associated with a conserved genomic mutation environment contributing to covariation in diversity levels between lineages. Our observations imply that genetic diversity is to some extent predictable.",

          "abstract": "<p>Carotenoids color many of the red, orange and yellow ornaments of birds and also shape avian vision. The carotenoid-pigmented oil droplets in cone photoreceptors filter incoming light and are predicted to aid in color discrimination. Carotenoid use in both avian coloration and color vision raises an intriguing question: is the evolution of visual signals and signal perception linked through these pigments? Here, we explore the genetic, physiological and functional connections between these traits. Carotenoid color and droplet pigmentation share common mechanisms of metabolic conversions and are both affected by diet and immune-system challenges. Yet, the timescale and magnitude of these effects differ greatly between plumage and the visual system. Recent observations suggest a link between retinal carotenoid levels and color discrimination performance, but the mechanisms underlying these associations remains unclear. Therefore, we performed a modeling exercise to ask whether and how changes in droplet carotenoid content could alter the perception of carotenoid-based plumage. This exercise revealed that changing oil droplet carotenoid concentration does not substantially affect the discrimination of carotenoid-based colors, but might change how reliably a receiver can predict the carotenoid content of an ornament. These findings suggest that, if present, a carotenoid link between signal and perception is subtle. Deconstructing this relationship will require a deeper understanding of avian visual perception and the mechanisms of color production. We highlight several areas where we see opportunities to gain new insights, including comparative genomic studies of shared mechanisms of carotenoid processing and alternative approaches to investigating color vision.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "<p>Generalist predators using small mammals as their primary prey are suggested to shift hunting alternative prey such as bird nests, when small mammals are in short supply (the alternative prey hypothesis, APH). Nest survival and survival of young individuals should be positively linked to small mammal abundance and negatively linked to predator abundance, but little information exists from survival of chicks, especially until recruitment. We test these predictions of the APH using 13 years (2002-2014) of life history data from a ground nesting shorebird breeding on coastal meadows. We use small mammal abundance in the previous autumn as a proxy for spring predator abundance, mainly of mammalian predators. We examine whether small mammal abundance in the spring and previous autumn explain annual variation in nest survival from depredation and local recruitment of the southern dunlin Calidris alpina schinzii. As predicted by the APH, survival from nest predation was positively linked to spring small mammal abundance and negatively linked to autumn small mammal abundance. Importantly, local recruitment showed opposite responses. This counterintuitive result may be explained by density dependent survival. When nest depredation rates are low, predators may show stronger numerical and functional responses to high shorebird chick abundance on coastal meadows, whereas in years of high nest depredation, few hatching chicks lure fewer predators. The opposite effects on nest and local recruitment demonstrate the diverse mechanisms by which population size variation in primary prey can affect dynamics of alternative prey populations.</p>",

However, projections from current Earth System Models (ESMs) understandably rely on simplified community responses that do not consider evolutionary strategies manifested as various phenotypes and trait groups. Here, we use a species-based modelling approach, combined with large-scale plankton observations, to investigate past, contemporary and future phenological shifts in diatoms (grouped by their morphological traits) and dinoflagellates in three key areas of the North Atlantic Ocean (North Sea, North-East Atlantic and Labrador Sea) from 1850 to 2100. Our study reveals that the three phytoplanktonic groups exhibit coherent and different shifts in phenology and abundance throughout the North Atlantic Ocean. The seasonal duration of large flattened (i.e., oblate) diatoms is predicted to shrink and their abundance to decline, whereas the phenology of slow-sinking elongated (i.e., prolate) diatoms and of dinoflagellates is expected to expand and their abundance to rise, which may alter carbon export in this important sink region. The increase in prolates and dinoflagellates, two groups currently not considered in ESMs, may alleviate the negative influence of global climate change on oblates, which are responsible of massive peaks of biomass and carbon export in spring. We suggest that including prolates and dinoflagellates in models may improve our understanding of the influence of global climate change on the biological carbon cycle in the oceans.</p>\n<p>The data provided here are the observed and modelled abundances (oblate and prolate diatoms and dinoflagellates), the observed and modelled environmental data (compiled data for sea surface temperature, Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation and disolved nitrates concentrations) in the North Sea, the North-East Atlantic and the Labrador Sea, and the phenological indices for the three different phytoplanktonic groups (i.e. oblate and prolate diatoms and dinoflagellates) and the three warming scenarios (the low, the medium and the high warming scenarios; SSP1-1.2.6 SSP2-4.5 and 5-8.5 respectively). The phenological indices are the maximum abundance, the day where the maximum abundance is reached, the day where the seasonal reproductive period is initiated and the day where it is terminated, the seasonal duration and the mean annual abundance. </p>",

Here, we make these explicit connections by combining field and laboratory experiments in wild mice. We first directly estimate natural selection on pigmentation traits and an underlying pigment locus, Agouti, by using experimental enclosures of mice on different soil colors. Next, we show how a mutation in Agouti associated with survival causes lighter coat color through changes in its protein binding properties. Together, our findings demonstrate how a sequence variant alters phenotype and then reveal the ensuing ecological consequences that drive changes in population allele frequency, thereby illuminating the process of evolution by natural selection.",

          "abstract": "<p>Comparative evidence suggests that adaptive plasticity may evolve as a response to predictable environmental variation. However, less attention has been placed on unpredictable environmental variation, which is considered to affect evolutionary trajectories by increasing phenotypic variation (or bet-hedging). Here, we examine the occurrence of bet-hedging in egg developmental rates in seven species of annual killifish that originate from a gradient of variation in precipitation rates, under three treatment incubation temperatures (21°C, 23°C, and 25°C). In the wild, these species survive regular and seasonal habitat desiccation, as dormant eggs buried in the soil. At the onset of the rainy season embryos must be sufficiently developed in order to hatch and complete their life-cycle. We found substantial differences among species in both the mean and variation of egg development rates, as well as species-specific plastic responses to incubation temperature. Yet, there was no clear relationship between variation in egg development time and variation in precipitation rate (environmental predictability). The exact cause of these differences therefore remains enigmatic, possibly depending on differences in other natural environmental conditions in addition to precipitation predictability. Hence, if species-specific variances are adaptive, the relationship between development and variation in precipitation is complex and does not diverge in accordance with simple linear relationships.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "<p>Phenotypic traits have been shown to evolve in response to variation in the environment. However, the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of phenotypic diversity can typically only be understood at the population level. Consequently, how subtle phenotypic differences at the intraspecific level can give rise to larger-scale changes in performance and ecology remains poorly understood. We here tested for the covariation between ecology, bite force, jaw muscle architecture, and the three-dimensional shape of the cranium and mandible in 16 insular populations of the lizards <i>Podarcis melisellensis</i> and <i>P. sicula</i>. We then compared the patterns observed at the among-population level with those observed at the interspecific level. We found that three-dimensional head shape as well as jaw musculature evolve similarly under similar ecological circumstances. Depending on the type of food consumed or on the level of sexual competition, different muscle groups were more developed and appeared to underlie changes in cranium and mandible shape. Our findings show that the local selective regimes are primary drivers of phenotypic variation resulting in predictable patterns of form and function. Moreover, intraspecific patterns of variation were generally consistent with those at the interspecific level, suggesting that microevolutionary variation may translate into macroevolutionary patterns of ecomorphological diversity.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "Probabilistic prediction plays a crucial role in language comprehension. When predictions are fulfilled, the resulting facilitation allows for fast, efficient processing of ambiguous, rapidly-unfolding input; when predictions are not fulfilled, the resulting error signal allows us to adapt to broader statistical changes in this input. We used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to examine the neuroanatomical networks engaged in semantic predictive processing and adaptation. We used a relatedness proportion semantic priming paradigm, in which we manipulated the probability of predictions while holding local semantic context constant. Under conditions of higher (versus lower) predictive validity, we replicate previous observations of reduced activity to semantically predictable words in the left anterior superior/middle temporal cortex, reflecting facilitated processing of targets that are consistent with prior semantic predictions. In addition, under conditions of higher (versus lower) predictive validity we observed significant differences in the effects of semantic relatedness within the left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior portion of the left superior/middle temporal gyrus. We suggest that together these two regions mediated the suppression of unfulfilled semantic predictions and lexico-semantic processing of unrelated targets that were inconsistent with these predictions. Moreover, under conditions of higher (versus lower) predictive validity, a functional connectivity analysis showed that the left inferior frontal and left posterior superior/middle temporal gyrus were more tightly interconnected with one another, as well as with the left anterior cingulate cortex. The left anterior cingulate cortex was, in turn, more tightly connected to superior lateral frontal cortices and subcortical regions — a network that mediates rapid learning and adaptation and that may have played a role in switching to a more predictive mode of processing in response to the statistical structure of the wider environmental context. Together, these findings highlight close links between the networks mediating semantic prediction, executive function and learning, giving new insights into how our brains are able to flexibly adapt to our environment.",

We analyze the link between survival and fecal glucocorticoid (GC) measures in a wild primate population, leveraging an unusually extensive longitudinal dataset of 14,173 GC measurements from 242 adult female baboons over 1,634 female-years. We document a powerful link between GCs and survival: females with relatively high current GCs or high lifelong cumulative GCs face an elevated risk of death. A hypothetical female who maintained GCs in the top 90% for her age across adulthood would be expected to lose 5.4 years of life relative to a female who maintained GCs in the bottom 10% for her age. Hence, differences among individuals in HPA axis activity provide valuable prognostic information about disparities in lifespan.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "A central question in evolutionary biology is how interactions between organisms and the environment shape genetic differentiation. The pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has caused variable population declines in the lowland leopard frog (Lithobates yavapaiensis); thus, disease has potentially shaped, or been shaped by, host genetic diversity. Environmental factors can also influence both amphibian immunity and Bd virulence, confounding our ability to assess the genetic effects on disease dynamics. Here, we used genetics, pathogen dynamics, and environmental data to characterize L. yavapaiensis populations, estimate migration, and determine relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors in predicting Bd dynamics. We found that the two uninfected populations belonged to a single genetic deme, whereas each infected population was genetically unique. We detected an outlier locus that deviated from neutral expectations and was significantly correlated with mortality within populations. Across populations, only environmental variables predicted infection intensity, whereas environment and genetics predicted infection prevalence, and genetic diversity alone predicted mortality. At one locality with geothermally elevated water temperatures, migration estimates revealed source–sink dynamics that have likely prevented local adaptation. We conclude that integrating genetic and environmental variation among populations provides a better understanding of Bd spatial epidemiology, generating more effective conservation management strategies for mitigating amphibian declines.",

          "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that carotenoid-based sexual ornamentation signals male fertility and sperm competitive ability as both ornamentation and sperm traits may be co-affected by oxidative stress, resulting in positive covariation (the ‘redox-based phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis’; redox-based PLFH). On the other hand, the ‘sperm competition theory’ (SCT) predicts a trade-off between precopulatory and postcopulatory traits. Here, we manipulate oxidative status (using diquat dibromide) and carotenoid availability in adult zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) males in order to test whether carotenoid-based beak ornamentation signals, or is traded off against, sperm resistance to oxidative challenge. Initial beak colouration, but not its change during the experiment, was associated with effect of oxidative challenge on sperm velocity, such that more intense colouration predicted an increase in sperm velocity under control conditions but a decline under oxidative challenge. This suggests a long-term trade-off between ornament expression and sperm resistance to oxidative challenge. Shortening of the sperm midpiece following oxidative challenge further suggests that redox homeostasis may constrain sperm morphometry. Carotenoid supplementation resulted in fewer sperm abnormalities but had no effect on other sperm traits. Overall, our data challenge the redox-based PLFH, partially support the SCT and highlight the importance of carotenoids for normal sperm morphology.",

These predictions may be impossible without a solid understanding of the factors that structure current food webs. The most fundamental aspect of food-web structure—the relationship between the number of links and species—is still poorly understood. Some species interactions may be physically or physiologically ‘forbidden’—like consumption by non-consumer species—with possible consequences for food web structure. We show that accounting for these ‘forbidden interactions’ constrains the feasible link-species space, in tight agreement with empirical data. Rather than following one particular scaling relationship, food webs are distributed throughout this space according to shared biotic and abiotic features. Our study provides new insights into the long-standing question of which factors determine this fundamental aspect of food web structure.</p>\r\n",

Although the brain areas indispensable for speech and song learning are known, the neural circuits important for enhanced or reduced vocal performance remain unclear. By combining in vivo structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging with song analyses in juvenile male zebra finches during song learning and beyond, we reveal that song imitation accuracy correlates with the structural architecture of four distinct brain areas, none of which pertain to the song control system. Furthermore, the structural properties of a secondary auditory area in the left hemisphere, are capable to predict future song copying accuracy, already at the earliest stages of learning, before initiating vocal practicing. These findings appoint novel brain regions important for song learning outcome and inform that ultimate performance in part depends on fac\ntors experienced before vocal practicing.",

          "abstract": "<p>Fitness effects of mutations may generally depend on temperature that influences all rate-limiting biophysical and biochemical processes.  Earlier studies suggested that high temperatures may increase the availability of beneficial mutations (“more beneficial mutations”), or allow beneficial mutations to show stronger fitness effects (“stronger beneficial mutation effects”).  The “more beneficial mutations” scenario would inevitably be associated with increased proportion of conditionally beneficial mutations at higher temperatures.  This in turn predicts that populations in warm environments show faster evolutionary adaptation but suffer fitness loss when faced with cold conditions, and those evolving in cold environments become thermal-niche generalists (“hotter is narrower”).  Under the “stronger beneficial mutation effects” scenario, populations evolving in warm environments would show faster adaptation without fitness costs in cold environments, leading to a “hotter is (universally) better” pattern in thermal niche adaptation.  We tested predictions of the two competing hypotheses using an experimental evolution study in which populations of two model bacterial species, <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>, evolved for 2,400 generations at three experimental temperatures.  Results of reciprocal transplant experiments with our <em>P. fluorescens</em> populations were largely consistent with the “hotter is narrower” prediction.  Results from the <em>E. coli</em> populations clearly suggested stronger beneficial mutation effects at higher assay temperatures, but failed to detect faster adaptation in populations evolving in warmer experimental environments (presumably because of limitation in the supply of genetic variation).  Our results suggest that the influence of temperature on mutational effects may provide insight into the patterns of thermal niche adaptation and population diversification across thermal conditions.</p>",

          "abstract": "Segregation distorters located on sex chromosomes are predicted to sweep to fixation and cause extinction via a shortage of one sex, but in nature they are often found at low, stable frequencies. One potential resolution to this long-standing puzzle involves female multiple mating (polyandry). Because many meiotic drivers severely reduce the sperm competitive ability of their male carriers, females are predicted to evolve more frequent polyandry and thereby promote sperm competition when a meiotic driver invades. Consequently, the driving chromosome's relative fitness should decline, halting or reversing its spread. We used formal modeling to show that this initially appealing hypothesis cannot resolve the puzzle alone: other selective pressures (e.g. low fitness of drive homozygotes) are required to establish a stable meiotic drive polymorphism. However, polyandry and meiotic drive can strongly affect one another's frequency, and polyandrous populations may be resistant to the invasion of rare drive mutants.",

          "abstract": "<p>Insular ecosystems share analogous ecological conditions, leading to patterns of convergent evolution that are collectively termed the “island syndrome”. In birds, part of this syndrome is a tendency for a duller plumage, possibly as a result of relaxed sexual selection and the reduced need for species recognition. Despite this global pattern, some insular species display a more colourful plumage than their mainland relatives, but why this occurs has remained unexplained. Here, we examine the hypothesis that these cases of increased plumage colouration on islands could arise through a relaxation of predation pressure. We used comparative analyses to investigate whether average insular richness of raptors of suitable mass influences the plumage colourfulness and brightness across 110 pairs of insular endemic species and their closest mainland relatives. As predicted, we find a likely negative relationship between insular colouration and insular predation whilst controlling for mainland predation and colouration, so that species were more likely to become more colourful as the number of insular predators decreased. In contrast, plumage brightness was not influenced by predation pressure. Relaxation from predation, together with drift, might thus be a key mechanism of species phenotypic responses to insularity.</p>\r\n",

By genotyping 6,063 CGG STR loci in a large cohort of trios and quads with an ASD-affected proband, we determined an unprecedented rate of CGG repeat length deviation across a single generation. While the concept of repeat length being linked to deviation rate was solidified, we demonstrate how shorter STRs display greater degrees of size variation. We observed that CGG STRs did not segregate by Mendelian principles, with a bias against longer repeats, which appeared to magnify as repeat length increased. Through logistic regression, we identified 19 genes that displayed significantly higher rates and degrees of CGG STR expansion within the ASD-affected probands (p &lt; 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup>). This study not only highlights novel repeat expansions that may play a role in ASD but also reinforces the hypothesis that CGG STRs are specifically linked to human cognition.</p>",

For the MSSNG cohort, PCR-free WGS was conducted on DNA samples of 1,811 trios of an autism-affected proband and unaffected parents and 114 quads trios of an autism-affected proband, an unaffected sibling, and unaffected parents. Library preparation and sequencing were conducted on the Illumina HiSeq X platform.  All samples were aligned to the GRCh38/hg38 reference genome using BWA-mem. Full details on the MSSNG data pipelines can be obtained from their website (Via MSSNG, <a href=\"https://research.mss.ng/\">https://research.mss.ng/</a>). For the NGC cohort, PCR-free WGS was conducted on DNA samples obtained from blood of 167 trios of an affected proband (young children needing intensive care) and unaffected parents. DNA samples were shipped to Illumina (UK) for sequencing and were prepared with the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample preparation kit (Illumina, Inc) as previously described (63,64). Samples were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500, and quality control and read alignment to the human reference genome GRCh38 was performed by Illumina as previously described. Average coverage obtained was 30–40 × for the nuclear genome and 800–1000 × for the mitochondrial genome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Genome-wide CGG STR genotyping through ExpansionHunter</span></p>\n<p>Genome-wide CGG repeat genotyping was conducted on the CRAM files, aligned to GRCh38, generated by the WGS described in the previous section. The short tandem repeat genotyping algorithm ExpansionHunter (version 5.0.0) was used, developed by Dolzhenko et al. The default parameters were used, and the GRCh38 FASTA file was used for the genome reference argument. For the “–variant-catalog” argument, a custom CGG-repeat catalogue JSON file was used as developed and described previously by Annear et al., however, it was updated for the GRCh38 reference assembly. The resultant output VCF and JSON files were processed through a bioinformatic pipeline, STaRparse (https://github.com/CognitiveGenetics/STaRparse), in order to automatically parse, filter, analyse, and annotate the extracted CGG STR data. STaRparse was build utilising Python (3.6.8) and R (3.6.3) environments. To ensure accuracy of repeat length predictions, loci were excluded based on sequence coverage and the presence of only flanking reads.</p>",

          "abstract": "A major challenge in evolutionary ecology is to understand how co-evolutionary processes shape patterns of interactions between species at community level. Pollination of flowers with long corolla tubes by long-tongued hawkmoths has been invoked as a showcase model of co-evolution. Recently, optimal foraging models have predicted that there might be a close association between mouthparts' length and the corolla depth of the visited flowers, thus favouring trait convergence and specialization at community level.\r\nHere, we assessed whether hawkmoths more frequently pollinate plants with floral tube lengths similar to their proboscis lengths (morphological match hypothesis) against abundance-based processes (neutral hypothesis) and ecological trait mismatches constraints (forbidden links hypothesis), and how these processes structure hawkmoth–plant mutualistic networks from five communities in four biogeographical regions of South America.\r\nWe found convergence in morphological traits across the five communities and that the distribution of morphological differences between hawkmoths and plants is consistent with expectations under the morphological match hypothesis in three of the five communities. In the two remaining communities, which are ecotones between two distinct biogeographical areas, interactions are better predicted by the neutral hypothesis.\r\nOur findings are consistent with the idea that diffuse co-evolution drives the evolution of extremely long proboscises and flower tubes, and highlight the importance of morphological traits, beyond the forbidden links hypothesis, in structuring interactions between mutualistic partners, revealing that the role of niche-based processes can be much more complex than previously known.",

          "abstract": "Fungal and arthropod consumers constitute the vast majority of global terrestrial biodiversity. Yet, the link from richness and composition of producer (plant) communities to the richness of consumer communities is poorly understood. Fungal and arthropod species richness could be a simple function of producer species richness at a site. Alternatively, it could be a complex function of chemical and structural properties of the producer species making up communities. We used databases on plant-fungus and plant-arthropod trophic links to derive the richness of consumer biota per associated plant species (coined link score). We assessed how well link scores could be predicted by simple attributes of plant species. Next, we used a multi-taxon inventory of 130 sites, representing all major habitat types in a country (Denmark), to investigate whether link scores summed over plant species in communities (coined link sum) could outperform simple plant species richness as predictor of fungal and arthropod richness at the sites. We found plant species’ link scores for both fungi and arthropods to be positively related to plant size, regional occupancy, nativeness and ectomycorrhizal status. Link-based indices generally improved the prediction of richness of fungal and arthropod communities. For fungal communities, both observed link sum (from databases) and predicted link sum (from plant attributes) had high predictive power, while plant richness alone had none. For arthropod communities, predictive performance varied between functional groups. For both fungi and arthropods, richness predictions were further improved by considering abiotic habitat conditions. Our results underline the importance of plants as niche space for the megadiverse groups of arthropods and fungi. The plant-attribute approach holds promise for predicting local and regional consumer richness in areas of the world lacking detailed plant-consumer databases.",

Here, we compare current approaches to detect footprints of divergent selection in closely related species. We analyzed 192 individuals from two interfertile European temperate oak species using 30 genomic microsatellites from eight linkage groups. These markers present little intraspecific differentiation and can be used in combination to assign individual genotypes to species. We first show that different outlier detection tests give somewhat different results, possibly due to model constraints. Second, using linkage information for these markers, we further characterize the signature of divergent selection in the presence of gene flow. In particular, we show that recombination estimates for regions with outlier markers are lower than those for a control region, in line with a prediction from ecological speciation theory. Most importantly, we show that analyses at the haplotype level can distinguish between truly divergent (bi-directional) selection and positive selection in one of the two species, offering a new and improved method for characterizing the speciation process.",

However, constraining the simplest measure of total information (Hartley-Shannon) in a statistical mechanics framework reveals a principle, the Conservation of Hartley-Shannon Information (<strong>CoHSI</strong>) that directly predicts both known and unsuspected common properties of discrete systems, as borne out in the diverse systems of computer software, proteins and music.  Discrete systems fall into two categories distinguished by their structure: <strong>heterogeneous</strong> systems in which there is a distinguishable order of assembly of the system's components from an alphabet of  unique tokens (e.g. proteins assembled from an alphabet of amino acids), and <strong>homogeneous</strong> systems in which unique tokens are simply binned, counted and rank ordered. Heterogeneous systems are characterized by an implicit distribution of component lengths, with sharp unimodal peak (containing the majority of components) and a power-law tail, whereas homogeneous systems reduce naturally to Zipf's Law but with a drooping tail in the distribution.  We also confirm predictions that very long components are inevitable for heterogeneous systems; that discrete systems can exhibit simultaneously both heterogeneous and homogeneous behavior; and that in systems with more than one consistent token alphabet (e.g. digital music), the alphabets themselves show a power-law relationship.</p>\r\n",

Despite the promise of linking observed relationships between dispersal and diversity to underlying metacommunity processes, empirical studies have faced challenges in providing robust tests of theory. We review experimental studies that have tested how dispersal affects metacommunity diversity to determine why shortcomings emerge, and to provide a framework for empirical tests of theory that capture the processes structuring diversity in natural metacommunities. We first summarize recent experimental work to outline trends in results and to highlight common methods that cause a misalignment between empirical studies and the processes described by theory. We then identify the undesired implications of three widely used experimental methods that homogenize metacommunity structure or species traits, and present alternative methods that have been used to successfully integrate experiments and theory in a biologically relevant way. Finally, we present methodological and theoretical insights from three related ecological fields (coexistence, food web and priority effects theory) that, if integrated into metacommunity experiments, could help isolate the independent and joint effects of local interactions and dispersal on diversity, and reveal the mechanisms underlying observed dispersal–diversity patterns. Together, these methods can provide stronger tests of existing theory and stimulate new theoretical explorations.",

          "abstract": "In most vertebrate animals, glucocorticoid hormones are the chief mediators of homeostasis in response to ecological conditions and as they progress through their lifecycle. In addition, glucocorticoids are a major part of the stress response and stress induced elevations of the hormone can make it difficult to assess glucocorticoid secretion in response to changes in life-stage and current environmental conditions in wild animals. Particularly when quantifying circulating levels of glucocorticoids in the blood which fluctuate rapidly in response to stress. An alternative method of quantifying glucocorticoids is as hormone metabolites in faeces or urine giving a historical sample related to the gut passage time that is less sensitive to stressful events which cause spikes in the circulating hormone level. Although the concentration of glucocorticoid metabolites are influenced by faecal mass thereby potentially affecting any differences in hormone metabolites detected amongst samples. In the present study, we aimed to detect changes in levels of corticosterone, the primary bird glucocorticoid, in relation to the phase of reproduction, in a breeding population of collared flycatchers by sampling corticosterone metabolites in droppings. We also tested how corticosterone metabolite concentrations were affected by ambient temperature and related to body condition in adult birds. Our results indicate that the upregulation of corticosterone between incubation and nestling feeding in female birds is crucial for successful reproduction in this species. Also, females appear to down-regulate corticosterone during incubation in response to lower ambient temperature and poorer body condition. Our results did not indicate a relationship between dropping mass and corticosterone metabolite concentrations, which suggests that our findings were linked to the regulation of corticosterone in response to predictable and unpredictable challenges.",

          "abstract": "<p>Female reproductive success is often limited by access to resources and this can lead to social competition both within and between kin groups. Theory predicts that both resource availability and relatedness should influence the fitness consequences of social competition. However, testing key predictions requires differentiating the effects of these two factors. <span lang=\"EN-US\">Here we achieve this experimentally by manipulating the social environment of house mice, a facultative communal breeding species with known kin discrimination ability. </span>Our results support the hypothesis that resource defence can be costly for females, potentially trading off against maternal investment. When competition for nest sites was more intense, subjects: 1) were more active during resting phases, 2) responded more strongly to simulated territory intrusions via competitive signalling, and 3) produced smaller weaned offspring. However, we found no evidence that the propensity for kin to cooperate was influenced by relatedness of rivals. Communal breeding between sisters occurred independently of the relatedness of competitors, and costs of competition with non-kin were not mitigated by greater inclusive fitness benefits. Rather, communally breeding sisters weaned fewer offspring when competing with unrelated females, indicating that competition with non-kin is more costly overall. Our findings thus demonstrate that social competition has fitness costs and that associating with kin is beneficial to avoid negative fitness consequences of competing with non-kin, in addition to more widely recognised kin-selected benefits.</p>",

          "abstract": "<p>Habitat complexity is one of the most important factors modulating species diversity. This feature comprises several interrelated attributes, such as number, size, and spatial arrangement of complexity-forming elements. However, the separate and joint effects of these attributes on diversity and community structure are still not well understood. Here, we assess the relationships between several structural-complexity attributes of the subantarctic kelp <i>Lessonia flavicans </i>and species richness, total abundance, and structure of kelp-associated macrobenthic communities. We predicted that longer thalli and larger holdfasts favour greater species richness and total abundance of invertebrate organisms. To test the prediction, an observational sampling program was established in two sites of the Strait of Magellan. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed both positive and negative effects of kelp structural-complexity attributes on diversity. Holdfast diameter and maximum frond length, followed by thallus wet weight, had the strongest positive fits to species richness and total abundance; the number of stipes, on the other hand, was negatively associated with both response variables. Longer fronds were associated with greater abundances of spirorbid polychaetes. Larger holdfasts supported larger abundances of Nereididae and Terebelidae polychaetes and the limpet <i>Nacella mytilina</i>. Contrarily, kelps with longer fronds and more stipes supported fewer amphipods. In this way, we demonstrate that different dimensions of habitat complexity can have contrasting effects on diversity and community structure, highlighting the fundamental role of multiple dimensions of kelp habitat complexity for local biodiversity.</p>\r\n",

The oceanographic features and diverse environmental conditions determine a particular marine biogeographic unit (Camus 2001) dominated by benthic invertebrates and extensive kelp forests (Friedlander et al. 2018).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:-1px;\"><span>To analyse the potential spatial variation in the effects of kelp’s structural complexity, the study was conducted at two sites (4 km apart) in the Strait of Magellan (Fig. 2), named “Bahía Buzos” (-53.627°S, -70.919°W) and “Carrera” (-53.587°S, -70.921°W). Both sites harbour <i>L. flavicans</i> forests of around 400 m<sup>2</sup>, located between 0.5 and 4 m depth (C. Velasco-Charpentier pers. obs.). Both sites are moderately wave-exposed, with a hard substratum consisting of boulders and large rocks covered by crustose coralline algae. The patchy rocky reefs extend from the intertidal to ~ 8 m depth.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An observational sampling program of kelp habitat complexity and associated communities was established in both sites between November 2018 and August 2019. Observations were conducted every three months in both sites. Punta Carrera was sampled only during spring and summer due to logistics limitations and harsh weather. At each sampling time and site, SCUBA divers deployed a 100 m transect parallel to the coastline. The transects were placed on substrata of similar rock composition (boulders), depth (0.5 – 2 meters), and inclination (~ 0°). In each transect, ten 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrants separated by ~ 3 meters were photographed with a Nikon D7200 camera equipped with an Ikelite housing and a rectilinear Tokina 11-16 lens. We selected quadrants with at least one <i>L. flavicans </i>specimen. So, the unit of replication was each kelp specimen (N = 10 per site and season). Each thallus was wrapped with a mesh bag (1 mm<sup>2</sup> pore size). Then, the holdfast was detached from the rock with a knife and the bag was swiftly closed to minimise the escape of mobile macrobenthic organisms. Within one hour after collection, samples were transported to the Laboratorio de Ecofisiología y Biotecnología de Algas, Universidad de Magallanes to measure the thallus morphology attributes and species sorting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:-1px;\"><span><i>Estimation of kelp structural complexity and associated biodiversity</i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once in the laboratory, we measured five kelp structural complexity attributes. The number of stipes, maximum length (i.e. thallus length, from holdfast base to the apex in cm), holdfast diameter (i.e. maximum width of the holdfast base in cm), and total wet weight in g (0.01 g precision) were directly measured from the collected kelps. Foliage cover was estimated from each digital photography. This variable was categorized as 1 (fronds cover between &lt; 10 - 30% of the quadrant), 2 (fronds cover between 31-50%), 3 (fronds cover between 51 - 80%), and 4 (frond cover between 81-100%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:-1px;\"><span>For each <i>L. flavicans</i> thallus, macrobenthic (&gt; 1 mm) mobile and semi-sessile organisms (<i>e.g</i>. mussels), in addition to tube dwelling sessile organisms (e.g. spirorbid polychaetes) were collected from thallus surface with aid of forceps and scalpels. In addition, the stipes and discs were dissected to collect organisms living in crevices and galleries. We used specialized literature and field guides to identify each individual to the lowest taxonomic level possible, usually species (Osorio et al. 1979; McLean 1984; Pastorino 2005; Häussermann and Försterra 2009; González-Wevar et al. 2018). Species-specific abundance was estimated as counts of individuals. These data were used to estimate species richness, defined as the number of taxonomic identities; total abundance, defined as the total number of individuals per taxonomic identities; and community structure, defined as the combination of species identities and abundances. Before the analyses, Pearson-product moment correlations were calculated among the explanatory variables in order to account for collinearity. </span></p>\r\n",

Differences in pathogen strain composition, diversity, fitness, and spatial distribution are generally ignored in epidemiological modeling and are rarely studied in natural populations, yet they may be important drivers of epidemic trajectories. To examine how these factors are linked to epidemics in natural host populations, we collected epidemiological and genetic data from fifteen populations of the powdery mildew fungus, <em>Podosphaera plantaginis</em>, on <em>Plantago lanceolata</em> in the Åland Islands, Finland. In each population, we tracked spatiotemporal disease progression throughout one epidemic season and coupled our survey of infection with intensive field sampling of the pathogen. We found that strain composition varied greatly among populations in the landscape. Within populations, strain composition was driven by the sequence of strain activity: early-active strains reached higher abundances, leading to consistent strain compositions over time. Co-occurring strains also varied in their contribution to the growth of the local epidemic, and these fitness inequalities were linked to epidemic dynamics: a higher proportion of hosts became infected in populations containing strains that were more similar in fitness. Epidemic trajectories in the populations were also linked to strain diversity and to spatial dynamics: higher infection rates occurred in populations containing higher strain diversity, while spatially-clustered epidemics experienced lower infection rates. Together, our results suggest that spatial and/or temporal variation in strain composition, diversity, and fitness of pathogen populations are important factors generating variation in epidemiological trajectories among infected host populations.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "<p>Understanding what processes drive community structure is fundamental to ecology. Many wild animals are simultaneously infected by multiple parasite species, so host parasite communities can be valuable tools for investigating connections between community structures at multiple scales, as each host can be considered a replicate parasite community. Like free-living communities, within-host parasite communities are hierarchical; ecological interactions between hosts and parasites can occur at multiple scales (e.g. host community, host population, parasite community within the host), therefore both extrinsic and intrinsic processes can determine parasite community structure. We combine analyses of community structure and assembly at both the host population and individual scales using extensive datasets on wild wood mice (<i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i>) and their parasite community. An analysis of parasite community nestedness at the host population scale provided predictions about the order of infection at the individual scale, which were then tested using parasite community assembly data from individuals hosts from the same populations. Nestedness analyses revealed parasite communities were significantly more structured than random. However, observed nestedness did not differ from null models in which parasite species abundance was kept constant. We did not find consistency between observed community structure at the host population scale and within-host order of infection. Multistate-Markov models of parasite community assembly showed that a host’s likelihood of infection with one parasite was not impacted by previous parasite infection, suggesting there is not a deterministic order of infection among the species we investigated in wild wood mice. Our results demonstrate that patterns at one scale (i.e. host population) do not reliably predict processes at another scale (i.e. individual host), and that neutral or stochastic processes may be driving the patterns of nestedness observed in these communities. We suggest that experimental approaches that manipulate parasite communities are needed to better link processes at multiple ecological scales.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "<p>1. Reduced light availability induced by eutrophication has dramatically affected the growth of submerged macrophytes and caused their rapid decline globally in lakes. Functional traits have usually been used to predict ecological processes and explain plant adaptation. Trait networks, which are constructed from a series of nodes (traits) and edges (trait-trait correlations), can reveal complex relationships among traits. Plant traits belonging to different organs are considered relevant for overall plant performance. Therefore, variation in trait network topology at the whole-plant level can better reflect plant adaptation and response to environments than traditional methods, but the mechanisms underlying the decline of plants from a trait network perspective are not well understood.</p>\n<p>2. In this study, based on a one-year manipulation experiment for <em>Potamogeton maackianus</em> cultured with four levels of light intensity, we constructed trait networks from 20 traits belonging to different organs.</p>\n<p>3. Our results showed that trait network connectivity decreases in harsh environments, probably due to increased trait modules responding independently to stress. Network connectivity was positively related to the plant relative growth rate (RGR), as high trait connectivity and coordination should be beneficial for plants to acquire and transport resources efficiently across the whole plant. Additionally, we found that specific stem length, leaf:root mass ratios, and leaf total nonstructural carbohydrates were hub traits with high connectivity. These hub traits expressed high phenotypic plasticity, had close links with plant growth, and consistently held their higher importance within the network across light gradients or seasons.</p>\n<p>4. We found that low phenotypic integration in stressful environments may constrain plant growth, which can provide important implications for understanding plant adaptation strategies to low-light stress and even predicting community dynamics in the context of global environmental change.</p>",

As a potential mechanism maintaining this variation, the pace-of-life-syndrome (POLS) hypothesis posits that consistent differences in the behaviour of individuals (i.e. ‘personality’) are intercorrelated and have coevolved with consistent individual differences in metabolism and life-history traits. Here, using adult male guppies, <em>Poecilia reticulata</em>, we tested under laboratory conditions (1) whether behavioural and metabolic traits vary consistently among individuals over time (≤ 7 days) and (2) the POLS prediction that repeatable behavioural traits should be intercorrelated with each other and with repeatable metabolic rate at the among-individual level. Furthermore, based on indicator models of sexual selection, we expected that sexually selected male colour ornamentation would predict individual personality and metabolic rate. We repeatedly assayed three behavioural traits (sociability, boldness, exploration) and three metabolic traits (resting metabolic rate, maximal metabolic rate, aerobic scope) in a set of males that varied in body size and colour ornamentation. All behavioural trait measures were repeatable, consistent with individual personality. Of the three metabolic traits, only resting metabolic rate (RMR) was repeatable. Behavioural trait measures were significantly intercorrelated and thus integrated in a behavioural syndrome. More ‘proactive’ males were bolder, more exploratory and more sociable than ‘reactive’ ones. However, contrary to the POLS hypothesis, <span lang=\"EN-US\">RMR</span>was not significantly correlated with any of the behavioural trait measures, suggesting that consistent individual differences in RMR do not drive or support differences in personality, or vice versa. Male colour ornamentation did not covary with behaviour or RMR and thus does not appear to be a reliable predictor of either behavioural or metabolic phenotypes. We therefore did not find any compelling support for the POLS hypothesis, suggesting that <span lang=\"EN-US\">individual differences in metabolism do not underlie the evolution and maintenance of among-individual  behavioural variation in our study population.</span></p>",

          "abstract": "Number of spines on the fruit is an important quality trait in cucumber. The inheritance and identification of molecular markers for fruit spine density gene can provide a basis for breeding and lay the foundation for gene cloning. Cucumber inbred lines NCG-122 with numerous spines and NCG-121 with few spines were used for genetic analysis and gene mapping in this study. Genetic analysis showed that the numerous spines trait in NCG-122 was qualitative, and a single recessive nuclear gene (ns) controlled this trait. The few spines trait was dominant over the numerous spines trait. In the preliminary genetic mapping of the ns gene, 8 SSR markers were found to be linked to ns, which mapped to chromosome 2 (Chr.2) of cucumber. The closest flanking markers SSR22338 and SSR11596 were linked to the ns gene, with genetic distances of 10.2 and 1.7cM, respectively. One-hundred and thirty pairs of new SSR primers and 28 pairs of Indel primers were developed based on sequence information in the preliminary mapping region of ns. Fifteen SSR markers and 2 Indel markers were identified to be linked to the ns gene after analysis on the F2 mapping population using the new molecular markers. The 2 closest flanking markers, SSRns-127 and SSR04219, were 0.7 and 2.4 cM from ns, respectively. The physical distance between SSRns-127 and SSR04219 was 266.1kb, containing 27 predicted genes. Csa2G285390 was speculated as the probable candidate gene for numerous spines. The accuracy of the closest linked marker to the ns gene, SSRns-127, for MAS breeding was 95.0%.",

I found several links that were predicted by recent theory while others were against theoretical predictions, e.g. fast growing individuals were more fearful. Thus, while I found personality to be integrated with life-history, I cannot fully support recent hypotheses aiming to explain such behaviour-life-history associations.",

Although past research identified the superior temporal gyrus (STG) as a crucial cortical region, the computational fingerprint of these cerebral transformations remains poorly characterized. Here, we exploit a model-comparison framework and contrasted the ability of acoustic, semantic (continuous and categorical), and sound-to-event deep neural network (DNN) representation models to predict perceived sound dissimilarity and 7 Tesla human auditory cortex fMRI responses. We confirm that spectrotemporal modulations predict early auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus) responses, and that auditory dimensions (e.g., loudness, periodicity) predict STG responses and perceived dissimilarity. Sound-to-event DNNs predict HG responses similar to acoustic models but, notably, they outperform all competing models at predicting both STG responses and perceived dissimilarity. Our findings indicate that STG entails intermediate acoustic-to-semantic sound representations that neither acoustic nor semantic models can account for. These representations are compositional in nature and relevant to behaviour.</span></p>",

          "abstract": "1.\tTheoretical models indicate that the structure of plant-pollinator networks has important implications for species’ reproduction and survival. However, despite the growing information on the mechanisms underlying such structure, we are still far from being able to predict the functional consequences of species’ structural positions in such networks. From the plants’ perspective, species position and roles in pollination networks might be related to traits describing flower attractiveness, availability, and dependence on pollinators. In turn, both, network metrics and species traits might influence plant fitness.\n2.\tDuring two field seasons, we collected data of the 23 most abundant plant species from a rich coastal community in order to evaluate the association between population and floral traits (floral abundance at the population level and flowers/individual, flower shape and size, flowering length, nectar volume, pollinator dependence), species-level network metrics (linkage level, specialization –d’–, weighted closeness centrality, network roles related to modularity) and plant fitness (seeds/flower, seed weight).\n3.\tFlowering length, flower size, flower abundance and pollinator dependence were positively related to increased generalization, as measured with different indices. More abundant species and those with larger flowers showed higher linkage levels (i.e. higher number of pollinator species), whereas longer flowering periods were negatively related to d’ and positively related to closeness centrality and important roles in the network. Likewise, plants more dependent on pollinators occupied more central positions in the network. Furthermore, species’ centrality in the networks was significantly associated with plant fitness. Specifically, central species in the network produced more and heavier seeds than the others. However, other plant traits, such as flower size and pollinator dependence had additional direct effects on seed production.\n4.\tSynthesis. Our study highlights how population and floral traits define the positions and roles of species structuring the pollination communities. Moreover, the relationships between network metrics and plant reproduction indicate, for the first time, the functional implications of these structural positions at the inter-specific level of community assembly.",

          "abstract": "Forested lands in the western USA have undergone changes in management and condition that are resulting in a shift towards climax vegetation.  These changes can influence the quality and quantity of forage for herbivores that rely on early-seral plants.  To evaluate how management of forested landscapes might affect nutrition for Shiras moose (A. a. shirasi) at large spatial scales, we focused on shrubs and evaluated summer diet composition, forage availability, and forage quality across 21 population management units encompassing >36,000 km2 in northern Idaho, USA.  We identified 17 shrub species in the diets of moose, 11 of which comprised the bulk of the diets.  These forage shrubs varied markedly in both energy (mean digestible energy for leaves ranged from 9.62 to 12.89 kJ/g) and protein (mean digestible protein for leaves ranged from 1.73 to 7.90%).  By adapting established field sampling methods and integrating recent advances in remote sensing analyses in a modeling framework, we predicted approximations of current and past (i.e., 1984) quantities of forage shrubs across northern Idaho.  We also created a qualitative index of population trend for moose across population management units using harvest data.  Predicted quantities of forage shrubs varied widely across the study area with generally higher values at more northern latitudes.  The quantity of forage shrubs was estimated to have declined over the past 30 years in about half of the population management units, with the greatest declines predicted for high-energy forage species.  The population trend index was correlated with the percent change in availability of moderate-energy forage shrubs, indicating that availability of forage shrubs and change in availability over time might be affecting population dynamics for moose in northern Idaho.  Our study highlights the importance of assessing how changes in forest management across broad spatiotemporal extents could affect wildlife and their habitats.",

          "abstract": "Crested auklets (Aethia cristatella), colonial seabirds of Alaska and Siberia, emit a citrus-like odorant from wick-like feathers.  We examined whether the odorant emission is linked to adrenocortical function and correlated with size of the crest feather ornament.  Conventional signals like the size of crest ornament are inexpensive to produce and thus may be prone to deception.  However, assessment signals such as the odorant could be more reliable if they impose costs and more proximate since they are continually produced.  This may be the case for the crested auklet’s volatile aldehyde odorant.  The signal is composed of highly volatile chemicals that appear to be products of fatty acid metabolism.  Adrenocortical function helps to mobilize endogenous resources for metabolism.    Elevation of corticosterone may be needed to sustain a reliable chemical signal, but there are physiological costs for prolonged elevation of circulating corticosterone.  We predicted that higher odorant emissions would be correlated with larger crest ornaments.  Furthermore, we predicted that odorant emissions would be linked to adrenocortical response.   Octanal, the most abundant compound in the citrus-like odorant, was positively correlated with crest size in males, and adrenocortical response explained 42% of the variation in octanal emissions, after controlling for stage of the breeding period.  Adrenocortical response was positively correlated with octanal emissions (rs = 0.57) in females.  We conclude that dominant individuals with greater capacity to mount a more robust stress response may have greater capacity to sustain odorant secretions.",

          "abstract": "1.The size of disease epidemics remains difficult to predict, especially when parasites interact with multiple species. Traits of focal hosts like susceptibility could directly predict epidemic size, while other traits including competitive ability might shape it indirectly in communities with a ‘dilution effect’.\r\n\r\n2.In a dilution effect, diluter taxa can reduce disease by regulating (lowering) the density of focal hosts (i.e., through competition), or by reducing encounters between focal hosts and parasites. However, these dilution mechanisms are rarely grounded in focal host traits, and the relative importance of host regulation vs. encounter reduction remains understudied.\r\n\r\n3.Here, we map focal host traits to disease—via these dilution mechanisms—in communities with diluters. We measured two traits (competitive ability and susceptibility) for eight genotypes of a focal host (Daphnia), tracked the densities of each genotype in experimental mesocosms (+/- Ceriodaphnia competitor/diluters), and monitored their infections with a virulent fungal parasite (Metschnikowia) over 6-8 host generations. We disentangled the impacts of both traits on the density of infected hosts and partitioned dilution mechanisms using path models.\r\n\r\n4.Higher susceptibility directly fueled larger epidemics. Simultaneously, weaker competitive ability indirectly suppressed epidemics by enabling higher densities of diluters. These higher densities of diluters reduced the density of infected hosts indirectly via host regulation. In contrast, encounter reduction was much weaker.\r\n\r\n5.Our experiment strengthens the dilution effect paradigm with a predictable, traits-oriented framework. Similar traits—susceptibility, competitive ability, and their covariance—could help predict epidemic severity in a variety of other systems. Partitioning the direct and indirect effects of diluters could also delineate how they impact disease. Such trait-based insights could help broadly predict the size of epidemics in diverse communities.",

In fragmented landscapes, habitat-specialist species must disperse through the anthropogenic matrix where remnant habitats are embedded. Here, we test the hypothesis that dispersing juvenile frugivores leave a footprint in the form of seed deposition through the matrix of fragmented landscapes. We focused on the Sardinian warbler (Sylvia melanocephala), a resident frugivorous passerine. We used data from field sampling of bird-dispersed seeds in the forest and matrix of a fragmented landscape, subsequent disperser identification through DNA-barcoding analysis, and data from a national ringing programme. Seed dispersal by Sardinian warblers was confined to the forest most of the year, but warblers contributed a peak of seed-dispersal events in the matrix between July and October, mainly attributable to dispersing juveniles. Our study uniquely connects animal and plant dispersal, demonstrating that juveniles of habitat-specialist frugivores can provide mobile-link functions transiently, but in a seasonally predictable way.",

          "abstract": "Phenotypic variability is increasingly assessed through functional response and effect traits, which provide a mechanistic framework for investigating how an organism responds to varying ecological factors and how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. Covariation between response and effect traits has been poorly examined at the intraspecific level, thus hampering progress in understanding how phenotypic variability alters the role of organisms in ecosystems. Using a multi-trait approach and a nine-month longitudinal monitoring of individual red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), we demonstrated that most of the measured response and effect traits were partially stable during the ontogeny of individuals. Suites of response and effect traits were associated with a response syndrome and an effect syndrome, respectively, which were correlated to form a functional syndrome. Using a bioenergetic model, we predicted that differences in the response syndrome composition of hypothetical populations had important ecological effects on a key ecosystem process (i.e. whole-lake litter decomposition) to a level similar to those induced by doubling population size. Demonstrating the existence of a functional syndrome is likely to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of phenotypic variation among individuals in wild populations across levels of biological organization, and the linkage between ecosystem and evolutionary ecology.",

          "abstract": "<p>The island syndrome hypothesis (ISH) stipulates that, as a result of local selection pressures and restricted gene flow, individuals from island populations should differ from individuals within mainland populations. Specifically, island populations are predicted to contain individuals that are larger, less aggressive, more sociable, and that invest more in their offspring. To date, tests of the ISH have mainly compared oceanic islands to continental sites, and rarely smaller spatial scales such as inland watersheds. Here, using a novel set of genome-wide SNP markers in wild deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) we conducted a genomic assessment of predictions underlying the ISH in an inland riverine island system: analysing island-mainland population structure, and quantifying heritability of phenotypes thought to underlie the ISH. We found clear genomic differentiation between island and mainland populations and moderate to high marker-based heritability estimates fo r overall variation in traits previously found to differ in line with the ISH between mainland and island locations. FST outlier analyses highlighted 12 loci associated with differentiation between mainland and island populations. Together these results suggest that the island populations examined are on independent evolutionary trajectories, the traits considered have a genetic basis (rather than phenotypic variation being solely due to phenotypic plasticity). Coupled with the previous results showing significant phenotypic differentiation between island and mainland groups in this system, this study suggests that the ISH can hold even on a small spatial scale.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "<p>Predators suppress prey populations and elicit defensive phenotypes in prey. The magnitude of predator effects depends upon several factors, including the density of predators, and their cue concentrations, in the environment. Predator density manipulations have often relied on laboratory studies that use unrealistic densities of predators and prey over unnatural temporal and spatial scales. Field studies can provide insights into predator-prey interactions under more realistic scenarios. However, field studies linking predator density and prey populations are limited by the challenge of manipulating predator densities or predicting predator densities in dynamic/stochastic environments. We exploited a somewhat predictable rise in predatory crab communities associated with ocean warming to evaluate the impacts of swimming crab density on ecologically important horn snails. Our approach combined long-term monitoring of crabs and snails with snail behavior surveys and snail tethering experiments repeated during and after a marine heat wave. Near the end of a marine heat wave in 2016, swimming crabs were found in 25% of marsh tidal creeks. No swimming crabs were found in these tidal creeks during cooler water conditions in 2012 and 2021. When swimming crabs were more abundant (e.g. 2016), horn snails experienced 7,533% more mortality and were 91% less abundant. The proportion of snails climbing vegetation was 454% higher when swimming crabs were more abundant. Thus, higher predator densities occurring during a marine heat wave were associated with changes in snail abundance, mortality, and behavior. Such changes could influence marsh food webs and nutrient cycling. Our findings highlight the value of exploiting climatic anomalies to understand ecological patterns linked to the top-down effects in ecosystems - a critical need in predator-prey ecology.</p>",

          "methods": "<p>Study system and site</p>\n<p>California horn snails (hereafter, horn snails) are ubiquitous in tidal marshes and mudflats across the Southern California Bight (Lorda &amp; Lafferty 2012). Throughout this region, horn snails are prey for several predators (Armitage &amp; Fong 2006; Lorda et al. 2016)and are intermediate hosts for parasitic trematodes (Hechinger &amp; Lafferty 2005; Lafferty et al. 2006b). Horn snails can be predated upon by predatory swimming crabs during high tides, when tidal inundation facilitates crab movements into mud flat and marsh habitats (Cote et al. 2001; Belgrad &amp; Smith 2014). In southern California, the abundance of these swimming crabs (e.g., the Xantus’ swimming crab, Portunus xantusii, and the arched swimming crab, Callinectes arcuatus; hereafter swimming crabs) is connected to sea water temperature. Warm water events (e.g., marine heat waves, El Niños) are associated with influxes of swimming crabs (Zedler et al. 1992; Williams et al. 2001).</p>\n<p>Consistent with observations during warm water events in 1982-83 and 1997-98 (Zedler et al. 1992; Williams et al. 2001), the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Mitigation Monitoring Program found elevated abundances of swimming crabs in San Dieguito Lagoon (hereafter SDL) during the 2014-2016 Pacific marine heat wave. SDL is a restored 123 acre brackish tidal marsh located in Del Mar, California (32° 58’ 40.4’’N, 117° 14’ 32.8’’W) comprised of marsh, mud flats, and subtidal habitats (e.g., tidal creeks). Tidal marsh is the dominant habitat in SDL and is defined by robust populations of cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) and pickleweed (Sarcocornia pacifica) that were started via transplants in 2008 (Walker et al. 2021; Beheshti et al. 2022). Mud flats and subtidal habitats account for 18 and 31 acres of SDL, respectively (Beheshti et al. 2022). Horn snails and swimming crabs co-occur on mud flats and marsh habitats, particularly at high tide.</p>\n<p>Lab Assay-Consumption:</p>\n<p>To assess the relative predation-risk of swimming crabs and Lined shore crabs on horn snails, we conducted a short feeding trial. We offered horn snails to individual adult swimming crabs [n = 5; biomass:  127 ± 19 g (mean ± 1SE)] and Lined shore crabs (n = 5; biomass:  15 ± 1 g) in plastic containers (30 x 25 x 25 cm, l x w x h) with flow through seawater. To standardize the number of snails offered to these different sized crabs, we added 95 and 10 horn snails to swimming crab and Lined shore crab treatments, respectively. The horn snails offered to crabs were 5– 28 mm in length (measured as the distance between the shell aperture and apex). This range is representative of the natural range of sizes observed at SDL. We systematically added snails to each replicate to make sure large and small snails were evenly distributed across swimming crab and Lined shore crab treatments. We assessed crab predation rates on horn snails 24 hours later.</p>\n<p>Lab Assay- Crab Abundance:</p>\n<p>In August 2016, we used laboratory mesocosms to understand if waterborne chemical cues from swimming crabs elicit defensive behaviors in horn snails. We exposed snails to one of three cues: No Crab, Swimming Crab, and Lined shore Crab (n = 7). We included cues from Lined shore crabs (Pachygrapsus crassipes) to compare to cues from swimming crabs because Lined shore crabs consume horn snails, have been reported to elicit defensive phenotypes in horn snails, and are abundant at SDL (Armitage &amp; Fong 2006; Lorda et al. 2016; Walker et al. 2021). All invertebrates used in our laboratory assays were collected from SDL. We collected horn snails and Lined shore crabs by hand, and we collected swimming crabs with baited, vinyl-coated crab traps [65 × 49 × 25 cm, l x w x h; covered with mesh (3.8 cm openings)] with 2 trap door entrances (16 × 8 cm, w x h).</p>\n<p>All replicates consisted of an upstream (9 x 16.5 x 9 cm, l x w x h) and downstream container (15 x 14cm, h x diameter) that received flow through seawater from San Diego Bay (32° 43’ 48.1’’N, 117° 12’ 51.0’’W). Upstream containers (1 L) drained into downstream containers (2.36 L) at a rate of ~1 L minute-1. Four drainage holes (2.5 cm diameter each) were drilled into the downstream containers 9.5 cm above the container floor. Each downstream container held five horn snails (≥ 10 mm length). To prevent snail escape, holes and the top of the containers were covered with plastic mesh (6 mm opening). We randomly assigned upstream containers to one of three treatments (No Crab, Swimming Crab, Lined shore crab). No Crab treatments were left empty. In Swimming Crab and Lined shore crab treatments, we included a single adult swimming crab or Lined shore crab, respectively [Swimming crab biomass: 138 ± 14 g individual-1 (mean ± 1SE); Lined shore crab biomass: 15 ± 1 g individual-1].  Crabs were not fed during the assay but were provided horn snails ad libitum prior to the study.</p>\n<p>We exposed horn snails in the downstream buckets to waterborne cues from upstream containers for 48 h. Then, we quantified the proportion of snails found above the waterline (i.e., the proportion of snails with their entire foot above the waterline). We monitored the proportion of snails climbing above the waterline because previous studies suggested that horn snails may seek refuge by crawling out of water containing predators and their associated cues (Belgard and Smith 2014).</p>\n<p>Lab Assay- Crab Biomass:</p>\n<p>Because adult swimming crabs are considerably larger than Lined shore crabs [138 ± 14 g individual-1 and 15 ± 1 g individual-1 (mean ± 1SE); respectively], we conducted a second behavioral assay in September 2016 to test if horn snails respond to Lined shore crab cues when crab biomass is increased. We included two treatments: No Crab (n = 7) and Lined Shore Crab (n = 6).</p>\n<p>All replicates consisted of an upstream and downstream container and were set up as described in the Lab Assay-Abundance Methods section. However, in Lined Shore Crab treatments, instead of adding a single crab, we added 113 ± 5 g of Lined shore crabs, equal to 12 ± 1 individual Lined shore crabs. We targeted this biomass because we observed strong effects of individual swimming crabs in our previous assays and their biomass was similar (105-194 g, n = 9).</p>\n<p>We exposed horn snails in the downstream containers to waterborne cues from upstream containers for 48 hours. After 48 hours, we quantified 1) if each snail was climbing and 2) if the snail had climbed above the waterline (i.e., climbed &gt; 9.5 cm).</p>\n<p>Temporal monitoring data:</p>\n<p>            Horn snail and swimming crab relative abundance data at SDL were obtained from the SONGS Mitigation Monitoring Program. This monitoring effort began in 2012 and surveys sites on an annual basis in the late summer or early fall (July-November; Beheshti et al. 2022). Each year, six tidal creeks were monitored except in 2016 when eight tidal creeks were monitored. Within each tidal creek, snail and crab presence were monitored at five sampling stations spaced 10-20 m apart. At each sampling station within each tidal creek, horn snail presence was evaluated along two transects placed perpendicular to the water mark. Along each transect, three quadrats (0.06 m2) were placed between the lower limit of vegetation (~ 1.3 ft NGVD) and the thalweg of the tidal creek (~50-60 cm water depth). This resulted in a total of six quadrats per station, and 30 quadrats per tidal creek. Swimming crab presence (presence/absence) was assessed at all five sampling stations in each of the six tidal creeks using a circular enclosed trap (0.9 m tall x 0.74 m diameter; 0.43 m2 area) and a beach seine (2 m tall x 7.6 m wide, 3.2 mm mesh) covering a ~46 m 2 area (see (Steele et al. 2006b, a). The proportional abundance of horn snails and swimming crabs was then calculated by dividing the number of tidal creeks where each species was observed in any quadrat (snails) or any trap/seine (crabs) by the total number of tidal creeks sampled (n = 6 or n = 8 in 2016).</p>\n<p>Mortality study:</p>\n<p>In September 2016 and 2021, we evaluated horn snail predation-risk at three tidal elevations of a common site (32° 58’ 39.8’’N, 117° 14’ 40.9’’W) using a tethering experiment. Specifically, we deployed 30 - 0.5 m2 PVC frames containing 25 tethered horn snails each. Each PVC frame included five lengths of braided fishing line (rated to 50lbs) running parallel across the frame at 10 cm intervals. Five horn snails were tethered to each of the five fishing lines attached to every PVC frame. Horn snails were individually tethered using a 5 cm length of braided fishing line (rated to 50lbs) attached to the apex of each snails’ shell with cyanoacrylate.</p>\n<p>We deployed tethered snails at three horizontal distances landward of MLLW (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 m). These horizontal distances were associated with an increase in elevation. At each distance, plots were either open to allow predators access to tethered snails or were protected by a plastic mesh cage (1 cm opening) to act as mortality controls (open plots, n = 5 both years; caged plots, n = 5 and n = 2 for 2016 and 2021, respectively). We deployed fewer caged plots in 2021 because no snails were lost from these in 2016 when predation was high in open plots. We surveyed the number of live tethered horn snails remaining in each plot after 48 h. Additionally, we counted the number of tethered horn snails that had buried into the soil in caged plots because previous studies suggested that horn snails bury in response to predatory crabs (Lorda et al. 2016).</p>\n<p>Mortality Study- Crab Traps:</p>\n<p>To characterize the subtidal predator community in tidal creeks adjacent to our tethering plots, we deployed two crab traps within one week of our tethering studies in both 2016 and 2021. Vinyl-coated crab traps [65 × 49 × 25 cm, l x w x h; covered with mesh (3.8 cm openings)] with 2 trap door entrances (16 × 8 cm, w x h) were placed in the center of the tidal creek adjacent to the location of our tethering site. Traps were placed 10 m apart and were baited with squid (0.23 kg each). After 48 h, we counted the number of trapped swimming crabs (P. xantussii and C. arcuatus).</p>\n<p>Field Survey &amp; Field Survey- Climbing Logit:</p>\n<p>To understand how changes in swimming crab abundance may be linked to the abundance, distribution, and climbing behavior of horn snails in the field, we conducted transect surveys spanning the intertidal zone at a single site (32° 58’ 39.8’’N, 117° 14’ 40.9’’W) at SDL in 2016 and 2021. Specifically, we placed five - 10 m transects perpendicular to the waterline starting at MLLW and extending landward. Individual transects were spaced 2 m apart. Along each transect, we recorded the 1) density of non-climbing horn snails, 2) density of climbing horn snails, and 3) percent cover of plants (mainly pickleweed) every meter using a 0.5 x 0.5m quadrat. Horn snails were considered climbing if their entire foot was attached to vegetation, rather than the bare sediment. Since horn snails are known to bury in the presence of crab predators (Armitage &amp; Fong 2006; Lorda et al. 2016), we searched the top 2 cm of soil in quadrats for buried horn snails.  We also evaluated the propensity of horn snails to migrate landward from the MLLW in 2016 and 2021 using a mark and recapture study (see Horn snail migration study in Appendix S2).</p>\n<p>Migration Study:</p>\n<p>We evaluated the propensity of horn snails to migrate out of “high-risk” habitats close to the MLLW using a mark-and-capture study. In September 2016 and 2021, we collected 100 horn snails from San Dieguito Lagoon (SDL). Snails were transported to the Coastal and Marine Institute Laboratory where their shells were dabbed dry and painted with red nail polish. The nail polish dried for at least 12 hours before snails were returned to SDL and released inside a 0.5 x 2.0 m plot at Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). The corners of the plot were marked with PVC stakes. We surveyed snail distribution and behavior 48 hours later. We systematically searched the area around the plot (see Fig. S2 for search area schematic), raking our fingers through the top 1-2cm of soil to recover any snails that may have buried themselves. For each recovered snail, we estimated the minimum horizontal distance traveled. The minimum horizontal distance was defined as the distance between the snail’s foot and the closest 2.0 m side of the deployment plot.</p>",

          "abstract": "<p style=\"text-indent:0in;\">Remote cameras are a common method for surveying wildlife and recently have been promoted for implementing large-scale regional biodiversity monitoring programs. The use of camera-trap data depends on the correct identification of animals captured in the photographs, yet misidentification rates can be high, especially when morphologically similar species co-occur, and this can lead to faulty inferences and hinder conservation efforts. Correct identification is dependent on diagnosable taxonomic characters, photograph quality, and the experience and training of the observer. However, keys rooted in taxonomy are rarely used for the identification of camera-trap images and error rates are rarely assessed, even when morphologically similar species are present in the study area. We tested a method for ensuring high identification accuracy using two sympatric and morphologically similar chipmunk (<i>Neotamias</i>) species as a case study. We hypothesized that the identification accuracy would improve with use of the identification key, and with observer training, resulting in higher levels of observer confidence and higher levels of agreement among observers. We developed an identification key and tested identification accuracy based on photographs of verified museum specimens. Our results supported predictions for each of these hypotheses.  In addition, we validated the method in the field by comparing remote camera data with live-trapping data.  We recommend use of these methods to evaluate error rates and to exclude ambiguous records in camera-trap datasets. We urge that ensuring correct and scientifically defensible species identifications is incumbent on researchers and should be incorporated into the camera-trap workflow.</p>\r\n",

We provided all observers with Adobe PDF files that included instructions, identification resources, and a test. We provided the literature observers with identification resources that consisted of excerpts from <i>Mammalian Species</i> accounts for both species (Best et al., 1992; Verts and Carraway, 2001) and a popular field guide to North American mammals (Reid, 2006). These materials represented the best available identification information attainable without examining specimens. We highlighted sections pertaining to pelage traits to guide observers to the most relevant information for identifications from photographs. We provided the key observers with the identification key. For both groups of observers, the test consisted of 20 slides, each showing three views of a single chipmunk specimen (dorsal, lateral, and ventral). We used three views for testing because in our field applications cameras fire multiple times providing photographs of an animal from multiple angles – on average, we captured 10.6 photographs of a chipmunk with each visit to a camera and only 7.2% of chipmunk visits to a camera resulted in a single photograph. For each slide, observers recorded a species identification and the numeric confidence-rank. Numeric confidence-ranks ranged from 1 to 4 for each slide, based on the observer's confidence in the attribution of species, from 1: no confidence, 2: not very confident, 3: somewhat confident, 4: very confident. Observers could only view their own responses during the testing process. The observers were field technicians working on chipmunk field research or undergraduate students in wildlife biology, but they did not have any prior knowledge about chipmunk identification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\">We tested if a training program would improve the accuracy of observers who used our identification key. All key observers (N=15) completed the training program. For the training program, observers practiced using the identification key to identify photographs of chipmunk specimens in two separate training sets. After each training set, we provided the trainees with the answer key, so that they could compare their answers to the correct answers and learn from mistakes. The first training set was the original 504 randomized slides showing nonants of specimens of chipmunks, used by the authors for the development of the identification key. The trainees coded each slide for each pelage trait, assigned a species identification based on their overall impression, and reported a numeric confidence-rank, following the procedure used for the development of the key. The second training set consisted of 168 randomized slides showing a single view (dorsal, lateral, or ventral) of a specimen. For each slide, the trainee assigned a species identification and reported a numeric confidence-rank. After completing both training sets and reviewing the correct identifications, we considered observers to be fully trained (hereafter “trained key observers”). We tested trained key observers using a post-training test, which consisted of a set of 56 slides, each showing three views of a single chipmunk specimen (dorsal, lateral, and ventral). For each slide, observers recorded a species identification and the numeric confidence-rank.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has frequently been reported in multiple sclerosis (MS). So far, HPA axis function in MS has predominantly been studied under pharmacological stimulation which is associated with a series of methodological caveats. Knowledge of circadian cortisol patterns and cortisol awakening response (CAR) is still limited. METHODS: A total of 77 MS patients (55 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) / 22 secondary-progressive MS (SPMS)) as well as 34 healthy control (HC) subjects were enrolled. Diurnal cortisol release was assessed by repeated salivary cortisol sampling. Neurological disability was rated by the Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Depressive symptoms and perceived stress were assessed by self-report measures. RESULTS: RRMS but not SPMS patients differed in circadian cortisol release from HC subjects. Differences in cortisol release were restricted to CAR. Treated and treatment naïve RRMS patients did not differ in CAR. In a RRMS follow-up cohort (nine months follow-up), RRMS patients with EDSS progression (≥ 0.5) expressed a significantly greater CAR compared to HC subjects. RRMS patients with a stable EDSS did not differ from HC subjects. Neither depressive symptoms nor perceived stress ratings were associated with CAR in RRMS patients. In a step-wise regression analysis, EDSS at baseline and CAR were predictive of EDSS at follow-up (R² = 67 %) for RRMS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circadian cortisol release, in particular CAR, shows a course specific pattern with most pronounced release in RRMS. There is also some evidence for greater CAR in RRMS patients with EDSS progression. As a consequence, CAR might be of predictive value in terms of neurological disability in RRMS patients. The possible role of neuroendocrine-immune interactions in MS pathogenesis is further discussed.",

          "abstract": "Remote tropical oceanic islands are of high conservation priority, and they are exemplified by range-restricted species with small global populations. Spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall and plant productivity may be important in driving dynamics of these species. Yet, little is known about environmental influences on population dynamics for most islands and species. Here we leveraged avian capture-recapture, rainfall, and remote-sensed habitat data (enhanced vegetation index [EVI]) to assess relationships between rainfall, vegetation greenness, and demographic rates (productivity, adult apparent survival) of three native bird species on Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands: rufous fantail (Rhipidura rufifrons), bridled white-eye (Zosterops conspicillatus), and golden white-eye (Cleptornis marchei). Rainfall was positively related to vegetation greenness at all but the highest rainfall levels. Temporal variation in greenness affected the productivity of each bird species in unique ways. Predicted productivity of rufous fantail was highest when dry and wet season greenness values were high relative to site-specific 5-year seasonal mean values (i.e., relative greenness); while the white-eye species had highest predicted productivity when relative greenness contrasted between wet and dry seasons. Survival of rufous fantail and bridled white eye was positively related to relative dry-season greenness and negatively related to relative wet-season greenness. Bridled white-eye survival also showed evidence of a positive response to overall greenness. Our results highlight the potentially important role of rainfall regimes in affecting population dynamics of species on oceanic tropical islands. Understanding linkages between rainfall, vegetation, and animal population dynamics will be critical for developing effective conservation strategies in this and other regions where the seasonal timing, extent, and variability of rainfall is expected to change in the coming decades.",

          "abstract": "Disturbances’ role in shaping communities is well documented but highly disputed. We suggest replacing the overused two-trait trade-off approach with a functional group scheme, constructed from combinations of four key traits that represent four classes of species’ responses to disturbances. Using model results and field observations from sites affected by two highly different disturbances, we demonstrated that popular dichotomous trade-offs are not sufficient to explain community dynamics, even if some emerge under certain conditions. Without disturbances, competition was only sufficient to predict species survival but not relative success, which required some escape mechanism (e.g., long-term dormancy). With highly predictable and large-scale disturbances, successful species showed a combination of high individual tolerance to disturbance and, more surprisingly, high competitive ability. When disturbances were less predictable, high individual tolerance and long-term seed dormancy were favored, due to higher environmental uncertainty. Our study demonstrates that theories relying on a small number of predefined trade-offs among traits (e.g., competition-colonization trade-off) may lead to unrealistic results. We suggest that the understanding of disturbance-community relationships can be significantly improved by employing sets of relevant trait assemblies instead of the currently common approach in which trade-offs are assumed in advance.",

          "abstract": "1. Body size is a fundamental ecological trait and is correlated with population dynamics, community structure and function, and ecosystem fluxes.  Laboratory data from broad taxonomic groups suggest that a widespread response to a warming world may be an overall decrease in organism body size.  However, given the myriad of biotic and abiotic factors that can also influence organism body size in the wild, it is unclear whether results from these laboratory assays hold in nature. 2.  Here we use data sets spanning 30 to 100 years to examine whether the body size of wild-caught beetles has changed over time, whether body size changes are correlated with increased temperatures, and we frame these results using predictions derived from a quantitative review of laboratory responses of 22 beetle species to temperature.  3.  We found that 95% of lab-reared beetles decreased in size with increased rearing temperature, with larger-bodied species shrinking disproportionately more than smaller-bodied beetles.  In addition, the museum data sets revealed that larger-bodied beetle species have decreased in size over time, that mean beetle body size explains much of the interspecific variation in beetle responses to temperature, and that long-term beetle size changes are explained by increases in autumn temperature and decreases in spring temperature in this region. 4. Our data demonstrate that the relationship between body size and temperature of wild-caught beetles matches relatively well with results from laboratory studies, and that variation in this relationship is largely explained by interspecific variation in mean beetle body size.  5. This long-term beetle dataset is one of the most comprehensive arthropod body size datasets compiled to date, it improves predictions regarding the shrinking of organisms with global climate change, and together with the meta-analysis data, call for new hypotheses to explain why larger-bodied organisms may be more sensitive to temperature.",

Reduced gene flow is expected to minimize the impact of genetically engineered (GE) crops on feral and natural populations and to facilitate the coexistence of different agricultural markets. The goal of this study is to link foraging behavior to gene flow and identify behaviors that can help predict gene flow for different bee species. To reach this goal, we first examined and compared the foraging behaviors of three distinct bee species, the European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., foraging on Medicago sativa flowers. Each foraging behavior investigated differed among bee species. Both social bees exhibited directionality of movement and had similar residence, in contrast to the random movement and shorter residence of the solitary bee. Tripping rate and net distance traveled differed among the three bee species. We ranked each behavior among bee species and used the relative ranking as gene flow predictor before testing the predictions against empirical gene flow data. Tripping rate and net distance traveled, but not residence, predicted relative gene dispersal among bee species. Linking specific behaviors to gene flow provides mechanisms to explain differences in gene flow among bee species and guides the development of management practices to reduce gene flow. Although developed in one system, the approach developed here can be generalized to different plant/pollinator systems.",

We tested the relationship between previously–estimated population CTmax and observed mortality, as well as the strength of CTmax as a predictor of mortality compared to local stream temperatures capturing varying timescales. Populations with higher CTmax experienced significantly less mortality in the warmest temperature treatment (25℃). We also found that population CTmax outperformed stream temperature metrics as the top predictor of observed mortality. These results demonstrate a clear link between CTmax and mortality from thermal stress, contributing evidence that CTmax is a relevant metric for physiological vulnerability assessments.</p>",

For both dynamic and static experiments (detailed below), we used handheld fish nets to collect tadpoles from streams. Tadpoles were held in stream water in insulated containers during sampling with frequent water changes to maintain temperatures. We transported tadpoles to laboratory facilities (Fort Missoula, University of Montana) for experiments via the protocol outlined in [Essner et al., 2012. Herpetol. Rev. 43, 247–249].    </p>\n<p><em>Dynamic CTmax Experiments (CTmax<sub>p</sub>)</em></p>\n<p>See manuscript and references therein for full details of CTmax experiments. Briefly, we sampled 10–24 tadpoles from each of seven populations of <em>A</em>. <em>montanus</em> in Montana. We held tadpoles for three days at 8℃, a commonly-experienced temperature among populations, without food to reduce the effects of natal stream temperature and feeding. For CTmax experiments, tadpoles were moved to an experimental tank and held in individual mesh containers. They were given two minutes to habituate before temperature ramping at 0.3℃min<sup>-1 </sup>began. CTmax was defined as the temperature at which tadpoles lost the ability to respond to tactile stimuli but fully recovered when placed in cooler temperatures. We used population median CTmax for analyses, hereafter referred to as CTmax<sub>p</sub>, representing previously-characterized CTmax.</p>\n<p><em>Static Thermal Stress Experiments</em></p>\n<p><em>A</em>. <em>montanus</em> tadpoles overwinter in their natal streams for at least one year [Brown. 1975. Comp. Biochem. Physiol 50A, 397–405]. To collect tadpoles for static thermal stress experiments, we returned two years later (3 July – 28 July, 2019) to substantially decrease the probability of sampling the same cohort. Since we permanently removed tadpoles from the population for CTmax<sub>p </sub>experiments, we did not resample the same individual. We collected ~60 tadpoles from each population (total n= 420).</p>\n<p>Tadpoles from each population were evenly and randomly assigned to one of five holding temperature treatments: 5℃, 10℃, 15℃, 20℃, 25℃. Temperatures were decided based on thermal regime data [Cicchino et al. In Press. Freshw. Biol]: 5℃ and 10 ℃ are commonly experienced temperatures; 15℃ and 20℃ treatments are near maximum stream temperatures; 25℃ is greater than current maximum stream temperatures but is ecologically relevant given current rates of warming [Isaak et al. 2017. Water Resour. Res. 53, 9181–9205]. Tadpoles were held in the temperature treatments for three days and fed <em>ad libitum</em> by placing rocks collected from their stream in the holding tanks, from which they graze algae. We maintained oxygenation using flowing water and bubblers. After three days, we counted surviving tadpoles.</p>\n<p><em>Local Stream Temperatures</em></p>\n<p>We characterized stream temperatures experienced by the tadpole at three timescales: 1) immediate, 2) annual, and 3) long-term/ multi-generational. To characterize the immediate and annual stream temperature metrics, we used quality-controlled [Dunham et al. 2005. USFS Tech. Rep. , 1–18] logged temperature data at 4-hour intervals from each stream (detailed in [Cicchino et al. In Press. Freshw. Biol]). Using Water Year 2018 data, we calculated “immediate thermal experience” by averaging maximum daily temperatures of the three days preceding sampling for the static mortality experiments. We calculated “annual thermal experience” by measuring the maximum temperature experienced in a year for each population. Lastly, we used modeled temperature data of 40-year averages of the mean temperature during the warmest month (August) for each stream (Isaak et al. 2016, 2017) to quantify “long-term thermal experience”. These metrics were uncorrelated with each other.</p>\n<p><em>Data Analysis</em></p>\n<p>Analyses were performed in R version 4.1.2 [R Core Team 2021]. Statistical significance was evaluated using α=0.05. To test differences in mortality among temperature treatments, we used a Fisher’s Exact Test for count data. Due to limited variation in mortality in other temperature treatments, we only investigated the relationship between the probability of mortality and CTmax<sub>p</sub> in the 25℃ treatments. For this and subsequent models, we used a logistic regression with a 2-column matrix of number of deaths and number survived as the response variable. To assess the strength of CTmax<sub>p</sub> as a predictor of mortality, we compared the performance of this model against ten other models: (1) null; each thermal experience metric modelling separately as (2–4) independent predictors, (5–7) additive predictors with CTmax<sub>p</sub>, and (8–10) interactive predictors with CTmax<sub>p</sub>. All models used a binomial distribution. We compared models using Akaike’s Information Criterion (Akaike, 1973) adjusted for sample size (AICc), AICc weights, and evidence ratios with the top model.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethics</strong></p>\n<p>All experimental protocols were approved by Colorado State University IACUC (16-6667AA) and the University of Montana IACUC (024-17WLDBS-042117).

The rate of living hypothesis posits that physiological damage from metabolism causes species with faster metabolic rates to exhibit lower survival rates. However, whether increased survival commonly observed in tropical and south temperate latitudes is associated with slower metabolic rate remains unclear. We compared metabolic rates and annual survival rates across 46 species that we measured, and 147 species from literature data across northern, southern, and tropical latitudes. High metabolic rates were associated with lower survival but latitude had substantial direct effects on survival independent of metabolism. The inability of metabolic rate to explain latitudinal variation in survival suggests 1) that species may evolve physiological mechanisms that mitigate physiological damage from cellular metabolism, and 2) a larger role of extrinsic environmental, rather than intrinsic metabolic, causes of latitudinal differences in mortality.</p>\r\n",

Discrete systems fall into two categories distinguished by their structure: heterogeneous systems in which there is a distinguishable order of assembly of the system's components from an alphabet of  unique tokens (e.g. proteins assembled from an alphabet of amino acids), and homogeneous systems in which unique tokens are simply binned, counted and rank ordered. Heterogeneous systems are characterized by an implicit distribution of component lengths, with sharp unimodal peak (containing the majority of components) and a power-law tail, whereas homogeneous systems reduce naturally to Zipf's Law but with a drooping tail in the distribution.  We also confirm predictions that very long components are inevitable for heterogeneous systems; that discrete systems can exhibit simultaneously both heterogeneous and homogeneous behavior; and that in systems with more than one consistent token alphabet (e.g. digital music), the alphabets themselves show a power-law relationship.</p>\r\n",

The transport dissimilarity is observed from the surface layer to the lower part of the mixed layer as atmospheric instability increases. Although the transport dissimilarity is accompanied by the development of plumes and thermals under unstable conditions, plumes and thermals can produce intense transport of momentum and heat simultaneously. It is convective circulations related to vigorous thermals that cause transport dissimilarity. The horizontal divergence induced by convective circulations imposes a dominant large-scale reduction in the along-wind velocity component near the surface, while the temporal variations in temperature mainly reflect the role of plumes and thermals. This difference in respective physical processes subsequently leads to dissimilar transport between momentum and heat under unstable conditions. Therefore, the influence of convective circulations on the momentum-flux estimation should be considered in</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> atmospheric numerical models, </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">particularly for the simulation and prediction of severe convective weather.</span></p>",

          "abstract": "How traits influence species persistence is a fundamental question in ecology, evolution, and paleontology. We test the relationship between dietary traits and both species duration and locality coverage over 40 million years in North American canids, a clade with considerable ecomorphological disparity and a dense fossil record. Because ecomorphological generalization--broad resource use--may enable species to withstand disturbance, we predicted that canids of average size and mesocarnivory would exhibit longer durations and wider distributions than specialized larger or smaller species. Second, because locality coverage might reflect dispersal ability and/or survivability in a range of habitats, we predicted that high coverage would correspond with longer durations. We find a non-linear relationship between species duration and degree of carnivory: species at either end of the carnivory spectrum tend to have shorter durations than mesocarnivores. Locality coverage shows no relationship with size, diet, nor duration. To test whether generalization (medium size, mesocarnivory) corresponds to an adaptive optimum, we fit trait evolution models to previously generated canid phylogenies. Our analyses identify no single optimum in size or diet. Instead, the primary model of size evolution is a classic Cope's Rule increase over time, while dietary evolution does not conform to a single model.",

          "abstract": "The ability to quantify animals’ feeding activity and the resulting changes in their body condition as they move in the environment is fundamental to our understanding of a population’s ecology. We use satellite tracking data from northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), paired with simultaneous diving information, to develop a Bayesian state-space model that concurrently estimates an individual’s location, feeding activity, and changes in condition. The model identifies important foraging areas and times, the relative amount of feeding occurring therein and thus the different behavioral strategies in which the seals engage. The fitness implications of these strategies can be assessed by looking at the resulting variation in individuals’ condition, which in turn affects the condition and survival of their offspring. Therefore, our results shed light on the processes affecting an individual’s decision-making as it moves and feeds in the environment. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be used to simulate realistic patterns of disturbance at different stages of the trip, and how the predicted accumulation of lipid reserves varies as a consequence. Particularly, disturbing an animal in periods of high feeding activity or shortly after leaving the colony was predicted to have the potential to lead to starvation. In contrast, an individual could compensate even for very severe disturbance if such disturbance occurred outside the main foraging grounds. Our modelling approach is applicable to marine mammal species that perform drift dives, and can be extended to other species where an individual’s buoyancy can be inferred from its diving behavior.",

However, the consequences of microenvironment modification for demography and species interactions remain unclear at the community scale. In a study of co-occurring alpine plants, we (1) determined the extent of species-specific microclimate modification by comparing temperature and soil moisture between vegetated and non-vegetated microsites for several focal species. We (2) determined how vital rates (survival, growth, fecundity) of all species varied in response to aboveground and belowground vegetative overlap with inter- and intraspecific neighbors as proxies for microenvironment modification. For (1), surface temperatures were buffered (lower maximums and higher minimums) and soil moisture was higher below the canopies of most species compared to non-vegetated areas. For (2), vegetative overlap predicted the most vital rates, although the effect varied depending on whether aboveground or belowground overlap was considered. Vital rate response to microenvironment-modification proxies (vegetative overlap) was also frequently context-dependent with respect to plant size and macroclimate. Microenvironment modification and spatial overlapping of individuals are key drivers of demography and species interactions in this alpine community.</p>",

          "abstract": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The genetic control of gene expression is a core component of human physiology. For the past several years, transcriptome-wide association studies have leveraged large datasets of linked genotype and RNA sequencing information to create a powerful gene-based test of association that has been used in dozens of studies. While numerous discoveries have been made, the populations in the training data are overwhelmingly of European descent, and little is known about the generalizability of these models to other populations. Here, we test for cross-population generalizability of gene expression prediction models using a dataset of African American individuals with RNA-Seq data in whole blood. We find that the default models trained in large datasets such as GTEx and DGN fare poorly in African Americans, with a notable reduction in prediction accuracy when compared to European Americans. We replicate these limitations in cross-population generalizability using the five populations in the GEUVADIS dataset. Via realistic simulations of both populations and gene expression, we show that accurate cross-population generalizability of transcriptome prediction only arises when eQTL architecture is substantially shared across populations. In contrast, models with non-identical eQTLs showed patterns similar to real-world data. Therefore, generating RNA-Seq data in diverse populations is a critical step towards multi-ethnic utility of gene expression prediction.</p>\r\n",

Their inheritance is thus more likely through one of the two sexes, a property they share with sexually antagonistic alleles. Previous theory has shown that pairs of linked loci segregating for sexually antagonistic alleles are more likely to remain polymorphic and that linkage disequilibrium accrues between them. I probe this similarity between drive and sexual antagonism and examine the evolution of chromosomes experiencing these selection pressures simultaneously. Reminiscent of previous theory, I find that: the opportunity for polymorphism increases for a sexually antagonistic locus that is physically linked to a driving locus; the opportunity for polymorphism at a driving locus also increases when linked to a sexually antagonistic locus; and stable linkage disequilibrium accompanies any polymorphic equilibrium. Additionally, I find that drive at a linked locus favours the fixation of sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit the sex in which drive occurs. Further, I show that under certain conditions reduced recombination between these two loci is selectively favoured. These theoretical results provide clear, testable predictions about the nature of sexually antagonistic variation on driving chromosomes and have implications for the evolution of genomic architecture.",

          "abstract": "Parasites play a central role in the adaptiveness of sexual reproduction. Sexual selection theory suggests a role for parasite resistance in the context of mate choice, but the evidence is mixed. The parasite-mediated sexual selection (PMSS) hypothesis derives a number of predictions, among which that resistance to parasites is heritable, and that female choice favours parasite resistance genes in males. Here we tested the PMSS hypothesis using the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, a species that can be heavily parasitised by Macrocheles merdarius mites, which are known to affect adult survival. We investigated the heritability of resistance to M. merdarius, as well as whether female O. taurus impose a mating bias against males susceptible to mite infestation. Female choice for parasite resistance is difficult to disentangle from the possibility that females are simply choosing less parasitised males due to naturally selected benefits of avoiding contracting those parasites. This is especially likely for ectoparasites, such as mites. We tackled this problem by performing a mate choice trial first, and then measuring a male’s resistance to mite infestation. Resistance to mite infestation exhibited significant levels of additive genetic variance. Although we found no relationship between mating success and parasite resistance, males with greater resistance to infestation mated for longer. If females control copula duration, given that short copulations often result in mating failure, female choice could act on parasite resistance.",

The first tab contains data for the heritability of mite resistance (to the mite Macrocheles merdarius) in the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus. The first column has the individual ID, the second column the ID of their father, and the third column the ID of their mother, which together comprise the pedigree information for a nested paternal half-sib/full-sib breeding design. The number of mites found on males after experimental exposure and the pronotum width of each male (in mm) are also presented. The second tab has information from another experiment about mate choice and its relationship to a subsequent resistance to parasites (also under experimental exposure). This tab has information on male ID, their latency to court females (seconds between being exposed to a female and starting to court), number of courting bouts (see MS), mating success (1 when mated, 0 when failed to mate), mating latency (seconds between starting to court and mating), and mating duration (in seconds). This information can be used to calculate courtship rate (see MS). Finally, this tab also contains information on the number of mites found on males after the subsequent (after the mate choice trial) experimental exposure to these parasites, and the identity of the block.</div><div class=\"o-metadata__file-name\"></div></div>",

          "abstract": "Social insect colonies are pinnacles of evolved altruism, but also contain dramatic conflict among relatives [1, 2]. In many species, a colony’s workers compete with the queen and each other over the production of males.  Interspecific comparisons demonstrate the importance of within-colony relatedness in determining the outcome of this conflict [3, 4], but facultative responses to within-colony relatedness are rarely reported [5-7].  Here, I report facultative matricide (worker killing of a colony’s queen) in the social wasp, Dolichovespula arenaria.  Matricide is strongly associated with high worker-worker relatedness, as predicted by theory, because closely-related workers value nephews more than brothers [8]. This pattern is the result of variation in both paternity frequency and the paternity skew of colonies with multiple patrilines, implicating worker-worker relatedness rather than a direct effect of multiple mating on queen survival.  Furthermore, occasional inbreeding can explain why some multiple-patriline colonies exhibit high paternity skew associated with matricide. In general, these results support the hypothesis that workers can facultatively respond to intracolony relatedness determined by queen mating behavior, and demonstrate a novel benefit of polyandry in annual social insects.  Facultative matricide shows dramatically how workers are evolutionary actors with interests that can diverge from the queen’s, rather than being ‘extrasomatic projections of her personal genome’ [9].",

          "abstract": "<p>Suppressing unwanted background sound is crucial for aural communication. A particularly disruptive type of background sound, informational masking (IM), often interferes in social settings. However, IM mechanisms are incompletely understood. At present, IM is identified operationally: when a target should be audible, based on suprathreshold target/masker energy ratios, yet cannot be heard because target-like background sound interferes. We here confirm that speech identification thresholds differ dramatically between low- vs. high-IM background sound. However, speech detection thresholds are comparable across the two conditions. Moreover, functional near infrared spectroscopy recordings show that task-evoked blood oxygenation changes near the superior temporal gyrus (STG) covary with behavioral speech detection performance for high-IM but not low-IM background sound, suggesting that the STG is part of an IM-dependent network. Moreover, listeners who are more vulnerable to IM show increased hemodynamic recruitment near STG, an effect that cannot be explained based on differences in task difficulty across low- vs. high-IM. In contrast, task-evoked responses near another auditory region of cortex, the caudal inferior frontal sulcus (cIFS), do not predict behavioral sensitivity, suggesting that the cIFS belongs to an IM-independent network. Results are consistent with the idea that cortical gating shapes individual vulnerability to IM.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "<p>1. Understanding the link between ecology and morphology is a fundamental goal in biology. Ants are diverse terrestrial organisms, known to exhibit ecologically-driven morphological variation. While relationships between individual traits and ecologies have been identified, multidimensional interactions among traits and their cumulative predictive power remain unknown. Because selective pressures may generate convergent syndromes spanning multiple traits, we applied multivariate analyses across a wide sampling of taxa to assess ecomorphological variation in an integrative context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. How well does morphology predict ecology? Moreover, are there quantitatively-supported ant ecomorphs? We investigated the links between trait morphology and ecology by assembling a morphometric dataset spanning over 160 species within 110 genera. Because ants occupy a wide range of ecologies, we compiled natural history data on nesting microhabitat, foraging stratum, and functional role into 35 defined niche combinations. This tripartite ecological classification and our morphological dataset were optimized under dimension reduction techniques including Principal Component Analysis, Principal Coordinate Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Random Forest supervised machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Our results describe ant ecomorphospace as comprising regions of shared, generalized morphology as well as unique phenotypic space associated with specialized ecologies. Dimension reduction and model-based approaches predict ecology with 77-85% accuracy and Random Forest analysis consistently outperforms LDA. While accounting for shared ancestry, we found eye, antennal scape, and leg morphology to be most informative in differentiating among ecologies. We also note some heterogeneity between trait significance in each ecological aspect (nesting niche, foraging niche, functional role). To increase the utility of ecomorphological classification we simplified our 35 observed niche combinations into 10 ecomorph syndromes, which were also predicted by morphology. The predictive power of these machine learning methods underscores the strong role that ecology has in convergently shaping overall body plan morphology across ant lineages. We include a pipeline for predictive ecomorphological modeling using morphometric data, which may be expanded with additional specimen-based and natural history data.</p>\r\n",

Morphometric sampling included linear measurements of 12 cephalic traits and 5 post-cephalic traits, with 5 additional traits that were not subsequently included in our analyses but are presented here, after preliminary analyses indicated overlap with other metrics, variation due to measurement artifacts, or lack of significance across all niche aspects. Fifteen selected traits have been previously correlated with ecology. All measurements were conducted on point-mounted specimens under stereo microscopy. Including raw measurements in dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis can result in body size driving the overwhelming majority of variation in a dataset, masking other potentially important contributors. To explore the impact of body size, we created two datasets for analyses: a dataset comprising raw measurements and a size-corrected dataset using only ratios. Tab 1 (all data (raw measurements)) is the raw measurements dataset; tab 2 (all data (ratio measurements)) is the size-corrected ratios dataset; tab 3 (tree-matched data (raw meas.)) holds a dataset of raw measurements pruned to taxa that are included in Blanchard and Moreau's 2017 comprehensive ant phylogeny to facilitate phylogenetic corrections; tab 4 (tree-matched data (ratio meas.)) includes the same taxa as in tab 3 but with the size-corrected ratio measurements. </p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "The view that the Y chromosome is of little importance for phenotypic evolution stems from early studies of Drosophila melanogaster. This species’ Y chromosome contains only 13 protein coding genes, is almost entirely heterochromatic, and is not necessary for male viability. Population genetic theory further suggests that non-neutral variation can only be maintained at the Y chromosome under special circumstances. Yet, recent studies suggest that the D. melanogaster Y chromosome trans-regulates hundreds to thousands of X and autosomal genes. This finding suggests that the Y chromosome may play a far more active role in adaptive evolution than has previously been assumed. To evaluate the potential for the Y chromosome to contribute to phenotypic evolution from standing genetic variation, we test for Y-linked variation in lifespan within a population of D. melanogaster. Assessing variation for lifespan provides a powerful test because lifespan i) shows sexual dimorphism, which the Y is primarily predicted to contribute to, ii) is influenced by many genes, which provides the Y with many potential regulatory targets, and iii) is sensitive to heterochromatin remodelling, a mechanism through which the Y chromosome is believed to regulate gene expression. Our results show a small but significant effect of the Y chromosome, and thus suggest that the Y chromosome has the potential to respond to selection from standing genetic variation. Despite its small effect size, Y-linked variation may still be important, in particular when evolution of sexual dimorphism is genetically constrained elsewhere in the genome.",

We tested for a link between the capacity to regulate glucose levels and survival. We also investigated for the effects of ambient factors, age, sex, and manipulated developmental and adult conditions (i.e. natal brood size and foraging cost, in a full factorial design) on glucose tolerance. Glucose tolerance was quantified using the incremental ‘area under the curve’ (AUC), with lower values indicating higher tolerance: a lower depart from baseline levels and faster return to them, after exogenous administration of glucose. Glucose tolerance predicted survival probability in old birds, above the median age, with individuals with higher glucose tolerance showing better survival than individuals with low or intermediate glucose tolerance. In young birds there was no association between glucose tolerance and survival. Experimentally induced adverse developmental conditions did not affect glucose tolerance, but low ambient temperature at sampling and hard foraging conditions during adulthood induced a fast return to baseline levels (i.e. high glucose tolerance). These findings can be interpreted as an efficient return to baseline glucose levels when energy requirements are high, with glucose presumably being used for energy metabolism or storage. Glucose tolerance was independent of sex. Our main finding that old birds with higher glucose tolerance had better survival supports the hypothesis that the capacity to efficiently cope with a physiological challenge predicts lifespan, at least in old birds. </span></p>",

          "abstract": "<p>Genetic relatedness in animal societies is often a factor that drives the structure of social groups. In the marine world, most studies which have investigated this question have focused on marine mammals such as whales and dolphins. For sharks, recent studies have demonstrated preferential associations among individuals from which social communities emerge. Assortment patterns have been found according to phenotypic or behavioural traits but the role of genetic relatedness in shaping the social structure of adult shark populations has, to the best our knowledge, never been investigated. Here, we used a social network analysis crossed with DNA microsatellite genotyping to investigate the role of the genetic relatedness in the social structure of a blacktip reef shark (<i>Carcharhinus melanopterus</i>) population. Based on data from 156 groups of sharks, we used generalized affiliation indices to isolate social preferences from non-social associations, controlling for the contribution of sex, size, gregariousness, spatial and temporal overlap on social associations, to test for the influence of genetic relatedness on social structure. A double permutation procedure was employed to confirm our results and account for issues arising from potentially elevated type I and type II error rates. Kinship was not a predictor of associations and affiliations among sharks at the dyad or community levels as individuals tended to associate independently of the genetic relatedness among them. The lack of parental care in this species may contribute to the breakdown of family links in the population early in life, thereby preventing the formation of kin-based social networks.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "Sperm are perhaps the most diverse cells in the animal kingdom, with enormous morphological variation between taxa, between species, between males and within an ejaculate. Considerable interest in sperm diversity has arisen following the realisation that sperm competition (post-copulatory sexual selection) is a powerful selective force in many organisms, and that sperm morphology has co-evolved with female reproductive tract morphology. However, the relationship between sperm morphology, sperm motility and fertilisation success is only partially understood. The extent to which between-male variation is heritable is largely unknown, and remarkably few studies have investigated the genetic architecture of sperm traits, especially sperm morphology. Here we use high-density genotyping and gene expression profiling to explore the considerable sperm trait variation that exists in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. We show that nearly all of the genetic variation in sperm morphology is caused by an inversion polymorphism on the Z chromosome acting as a ‘supergene’. These results provide a striking example of two evolutionary genetic predictions. First, that in species where females are the heterogametic sex, genetic variation affecting sexually dimorphic traits will accumulate on the Z chromosome. Second, recombination suppression at the inversion allows beneficial dominant alleles to become fixed on whichever haplotype they first arise, without being exchanged onto other haplotypes. Finally, we show that the inversion polymorphism will be stably maintained by heterozygote advantage, because heterozygous males have the fastest and most successful sperm with no apparent fitness cost.",

          "abstract": "Applying toxicogenomics to improving the safety profile of drug candidates and crop protection molecules is most useful when it identifies relevant biological and mechanistic information that highlights risks and informs risk mitigation strategies.  Pathway-based approaches, such as GSEA, integrate toxicogenomic data with known biological process and pathways.  Network methods help define unknown biological processes and offer data reduction advantages.  Integrating the two approaches would improve interpretation of toxicogenomic information.  Barriers to the routine application of these methods in genome-wide transcriptomic studies include a need for “hands-on” computer programming experience, the selection of one or more analysis methods (e.g. pathway analysis methods), the sensitivity of results to algorithm parameters, and challenges in linking differential gene expression to variation in safety outcomes.  To facilitate adoption and reproducibility of gene expression analysis in safety studies, we have developed Collaborative Toxicogenomics (CTox), an open-access integrated web portal using the Django web framework.  The software, developed with the Python programming language, is modular, extensible and implements “best-practice” methods in computational biology.  New study results are compared to over 4,000 rodent liver experiments from Drug Matrix and open TG-GATEs.  A unique feature of the software is the ability to integrate clinical chemistry and histopathology-derived outcomes with results from gene expression studies, leading to relevant mechanistic conclusions.   We describe its application by analyzing the effects of several toxicants on liver gene expression and exemplify application to predicting toxicity study outcomes upon chronic treatment from expression changes in acute-duration studies.",

We carried out laboratory behavioral assays and repeated habitat and diet measurement in a semi-natural mesocosm system. We found considerable repeatability in individual behavior, largely consistent with a proactive/reactive behavioral syndrome. We also found modest individual repeatability in microhabitat use and relatively strong individual specialization in diet. However, no measure of niche use in the mesocosms was significantly predicted by individual personality. Further studies of this type will be needed to assess whether links between individual behavior and resource use are more important in other species or ecological contexts.",

          "abstract": "1. Inter-annual variation in seasonal weather patterns causes shifts in the relative timing of phenological events of species within communities, but we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how these phenological shifts affect species interactions. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to predicting how inter-annual variation affects populations and communities. 2. Species’ phenologies, particularly the timing of offspring arrival, play an important role in the annual cycles of community assembly. We hypothesize that shifts in relative arrival of offspring can alter interspecific interactions through a mechanism called size-mediated priority effects (SMPE), in which individuals that arrive earlier can grow to achieve a body size advantage over those that arrive later. 3. In this study, we used an experimental approach to isolate and quantify the importance of SMPE for species interactions. Specifically, we simulated shifts in relative arrival of the nymphs of two dragonfly species to determine the consequences for their interactions as intraguild predators. 4. We found that shifts in relative arrival altered not only predation strength but also the nature of predator-prey interactions. When arrival differences were great, SMPE allowed the early arriver to prey intensely upon the late arriver, causing exclusion of the late arriver from nearly all habitats. As arrival differences decreased, the early arriver’s size advantage also decreased. When arrival differences were smallest, there was mutual predation, and the two species coexisted in similar abundances across habitats. Importantly, we also found a nonlinear scaling relationship between shifts in relative arrival and predation strength. Specifically, small shifts in relative arrival caused large changes in predation strength while subsequent changes had relatively minor effects. 5. These results demonstrate that SMPE can alter not only the outcome of interactions but also the demographic rates of species and the structure of communities. Elucidating the mechanisms that link phenological shifts to species interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of seasonal communities as well as for predicting the effects of climate change on these communities.",

          "abstract": "<p>Plant traits are useful for predicting how species may respond to environmental change and/or influence ecosystem properties. Understanding the extent to which traits vary within species and across climatic gradients is particularly important for understanding how species may respond to climate change. We explored whether climate drives spatial patterns of intraspecific trait variation for three traits (specific leaf area (SLA), plant height, and leaf nitrogen content (Nmass)) across 122 grass species (family: Poaceae) with a combined distribution across six continents. We tested the hypothesis that the sensitivity (i.e., slope) of intraspecific trait responses to climate across space would be related to the species’ typical form and function (e.g., leaf economics, stature, and lifespan). We observed both positive and negative intraspecific trait responses to climate with the distribution of slope coefficients across species straddling zero for precipitation, temperature, and climate seasonality. As hypothesized, variation in slope coefficients across species was partially explained by leaf economics and lifespan. For example, acquisitive species with nitrogen-rich leaves grew taller and produced leaves with higher SLA in warmer regions compared to species with low N<sub>mass</sub>. Compared to perennials, annual grasses invested in leaves with higher SLA yet decreased height and N<sub>mass</sub> in regions with high precipitation seasonality. Thus, while the influence of climate on trait expression may at first appear idiosyncratic, variation in trait-climate slope coefficients is at least partially explained by the species’ typical form and function. Overall, our results suggest that a species’ mean location along one axis of trait variation (e.g., leaf economics) could influence how traits along a separate axis of variation (e.g., plant size) respond to spatial variation in climate.</p>",

For this analysis, we focus on three traits of interest: specific leaf area (SLA), plant height, and mass-based leaf nitrogen content (N<sub>mass</sub>). All trait measurements were georeferenced with latitude and longitude coordinates. For each trait measurement, we extracted and paired the following high-resolution (30 arc sec, ~1km) climate statistics from CHELSA V2.1 (Karger et al. 2017; <a href=\"https://chelsa-climate.org/\">https://chelsa-climate.org/</a>): mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation seasonality (PS; the standard deviation of the monthly precipitation estimates expressed as a percentage of the mean of those estimates (i.e. the annual mean)), temperature seasonality (TS; standard deviation of the monthly mean temperatures), mean monthly precipitation of the warmest and coldest quarter of the year (Pwarm and Pcold, respectively), and mean monthly temperature of the warmest and coldest quarter of the year (Twarm and Tcold, respectively).</p>\n<p>To avoid over-weighting regions that were heavily sampled (i.e., parts of Europe and North America, see Fig. 2 in paper), we aggregated our trait-climate dataset by rounding latitude-longitude coordinates to the nearest first decimal point and averaging climate and trait values for a species within that binned coordinate. We then subset this binned dataset to include only species for which we had at least 10 records spanning a MAP gradient of 100 mm, a MAT gradient of 2℃, and a correlation between MAP and MAT of no more than 0.8. This was done to prevent fitting models when MAP and MAT were highly collinear or when all measurements were made over a narrow range of climate values which might result in extreme slope coefficients (Sandel et al. 2021). Based on these criteria, our final global grass trait-climate dataset spanned six continents, covered all of Earth’s major terrestrial biomes, and included 2,648 measurements of SLA (n= 109 species), 1,359 measurements of N<sub>mass</sub> (n = 61 species), and 1,439 measurements of plant height (n = 66 species) (Fig. 2).</p>\n<p>NOTE: THESE RAW TRAIT DATA ARE NOT SHARED HERE DUE TO RESTRICTIONS FROM DATABASES MENTIONED ABOVE. THE TRAIT-CLIMATE SLOPE COEFFICIENTS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH ARE SHARED.</p>\n<p>Trait data were log-transformed prior to analyses to meet assumptions of normality. For each species and trait, we ran two separate simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models predicting trait values from climate variables using the errorsarlm() function in the <em>spdep</em> package (Bivand et al. 2015), with the neighborhood of a point being defined as the three nearest points. The first model included mean climate characteristics (MAP, MAT, PS, TS) while the second included mean monthly climate of the warmest and coldest quarters of the year (Pwarm, Pcold, Twarm, and Tcold). The use of SAR models accounts for spatial autocorrelation in our data, a common phenomenon in ecology where nearby observations are more similar than would be expected by chance (Legendre 1993). These models each produced 12 trait-climate slope coefficients (3 traits, 4 climate variables). Using Student t-tests, we assessed whether the mean of each SAR slope coefficients across species was significantly different from zero (Bonferroni-adjusted p-values for 12 independent tests; alpha = 0.004).</p>\n<p>To test whether variation in intraspecific sensitivity of traits to climate could be explained by mean species traits, we ran phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regression models with the intraspecific trait-climate slope coefficients (e.g., MAP vs. SLA slope) as the dependent variable and the following mean species traits as independent variables: SLA, Nmass, height, lifespan (i.e., perennial or annual), and photosynthetic pathway (i.e., C<sub>4</sub> or C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis). We used PGLS models to account for the possibility that more closely related species have more similar responses to climate than would be expected by chance (see Fig. S1 for complete phylogenetic tree). In our models, we log-transformed continuous mean traits (SLA, N<sub>mass</sub>, and Height). To simplify these global models and determine which mean traits were most important for understanding variability in the trait-climate slope coefficients, we performed an automated model selection using the dredge() function in the <em>MuMln</em> package (Barton and Barton 2015). We then performed model averaging on those models with a delta AIC<sub>c </sub>of &lt;2, and produced partial residual plots to visualize the effects of individual significant predictor variables on variation in the slope coefficients while also considering other components of the final model.</p>\n<p>Finally, we explored the correlation between mean continuous traits for all species used in this study (n=122) using standard major axis (SMA) regression (sma function in the <em>smatr</em> package; Warton et al. 2018) and tested for trait differences based on photosynthetic pathway and lifespan using two-sample t-tests. This was done to confirm that the mean traits for our species were similarly coordinated according to global spectrum of plant form and function (Diaz et al. 2016).

          "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Accurate prediction of disease progression is difficult, and new biomarkers for clinical use are essential. Recently, we reported that the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL5/Uch37 is a new prognostic marker in both rectal cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Here, we have assessed by immunohistochemistry UCHL5 tumor expression in gastric cancer.  The study cohort comprised 650 patients, who underwent surgery in Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, between 1983 and 2009. We investigated the association of cytoplasmic UCHL5 tumor expression to assess clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. Positive cytoplasmic UCHL5 tumor immunoexpression is linked to increased survival of patients with small (<5 cm) tumors (p = 0.001), disease stages I-II (p = 0.025), and age 66 years or older (p = 0.037). UCHL5 is thus a potential marker in gastric cancer with new prognostic relevance.",

          "abstract": "The efficiency with which individuals extract energy from their environment defines their survival and reproductive success, and thus their selective contribution to the population. Individuals that forage more efficiently (i.e., when energy gained exceeds energy expended) are likely to be more successful at raising viable offspring than individuals that forage less efficiently. Our goal was to test this prediction in large long-lived mammals under free-ranging conditions. To do so, we equipped 20 lactating Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on the Kerguelen Island in the Southern Ocean with tags that recorded GPS locations, depth and tri-axial acceleration to determine at-sea behaviours and detailed time-activity budgets during their foraging trips. We also simultaneously measured energy spent at sea using the doubly-labeled water (DLW) method, and estimated the energy acquired while foraging from 1) type and energy content of prey species present in scat remains, and 2) numbers of prey capture attempts determined from head acceleration. Finally, we followed the growth of 36 pups from birth until weaning (of which 20 were the offspring of our 20 tracked mothers), and used the relative differences in body mass of pups at weaning as an index of first year survival and thus the reproductive success of their mothers. Our results show that females with greater foraging efficiencies produced relatively bigger pups at weaning. These mothers achieved greater foraging efficiency by extracting more energy per minute of diving rather than by reducing energy expenditure. This strategy also resulted in the females spending less time diving and less time overall at sea, which allowed them to deliver higher quality milk to their pups, or allowed their pups to suckle more frequently, or both. The linkage we demonstrate between reproductive success and the quality of individuals as foragers provides an individual-based quantitative framework to investigate how changes in the availability and accessibility of prey can affect fitness of animals.",

We measured pupil-size in typical adult humans viewing a bistable-rotating cylinder, constructed so the luminance of the front surface changes with perceived direction of rotation. In some participants, pupil diameter oscillated in phase with the ambiguous perception, more dilated when the black surface was in front. Importantly, the magnitude of oscillation predicts autistic traits of participants, assessed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient AQ. Further experiments suggest that these results are driven by differences in perceptual styles: high AQ participants focus on the front surface of the rotating cylinder, while those with low AQ distribute attention to both surfaces in a more global, holistic style. This is the first evidence that pupillometry reliably tracks inter-individual differences in perceptual styles; it does so quickly and objectively, without interfering with spontaneous perceptual strategies.",

Recent studies relate inter-regional connectivity to gene expression, but the relationship to regional cell-type distributions remains understudied. Here, we utilize whole-brain mapping of neuronal and non-neuronal subtypes via the Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection (MISS) algorithm to model inter-regional connectivity as a function of regional cell-type composition with machine learning. We deployed random forest algorithms for predicting connectivity from cell type densities, demonstrating surprisingly strong prediction accuracy of cell types in general and particular cells like oligodendrocytes. We found evidence of a strong distance-dependency in the cell-connectivity relationship, with layer-specific excitatory neurons contributing the most for long-range connectivity, while vascular and astroglia are salient for short-range connections. Our results demonstrate a link between cell types and connectivity, providing a roadmap for examining this relationship in other species, including humans.</p>",

This raises the pressing question if a general understanding of ecological effects is achievable. These data show that this is indeed possible. It contains code that calculates the feasibility domain size (a proxy for coexistence) for bi- and tritrophic communities challenged by environmental change. Some of this code simply returns the output of a closed-form expressions (i.e. simple equations), while some rely on simulations that require specific packages.</p>\n<p>The data also contain presence/absence data of macroinvertebrate taxa and water chemistry variables measured across sites (that are either severely or weakly modified by human activity, quantified via land use) at US streams. With these data, we were able to test if sites that share the same community have similar water chemistry, in other words: how tightly is a community linked to a certain water chemistry? This analysis demonstrates how to apply our theory to the analysis of field data, and lends support to effects of land use change on coexistence in natural invertebrate communities.</p>",

Here, we describe a stage-structured matrix model of hierarchical demography, which provides a framework for understanding social influences on population change.  Our approach accounts for dispersal and affords insight into population dynamics at multiple scales.  The method has close parallels to integral projection models, but focuses on a discrete characteristic (group size).  Using detailed long-term records for meerkats (Suricata suricatta), we apply our model to explore patterns of local density dependence and implications of group size for group and population growth.  Taking into account dispersers, the model predicts a per-capita growth rate for social groups that declines with group size.  It predicts that larger social groups should produce a greater number of new breeding groups; thus dominant breeding females (responsible for most reproduction) are likely to be more productive in larger groups.  Considering the potential for future population growth, larger groups have the highest reproductive value, but per-capita reproductive value is maximised for individuals in smaller groups.  Across a plausible range of dispersal conditions, meerkats' long-run population growth rate is maximised when individuals form groups of intermediate size.",

Biological or functional trait-based approaches that capture life strategy, morphology and behavioural characteristics have received far less attention than taxonomic diversity in this context, despite their more intuitive link to ecosystem functioning.\r\nMacrophyte primary production underpins aquatic food webs, regulates benthic and pelagic ecosystems and is a key aspect of the global carbon cycle. This study spans a range of aquatic biomes across Europe and aims to examine potential for predicting primary production of macrophyte communities based on the functional traits of species and identify the traits that are the most informative indicators of macrophyte production.\r\nMacrophyte primary production was assessed based on the oxygen production of the whole community, linked to biomasses of selected biological traits derived of its component species and analysed using the novel boosted regression trees modelling technique.\r\nResults showed that functional traits derived from macrophyte community data explained most of the variation in primary production of macrophyte communities without the need to incorporate environmental data on the habitats. Macrophyte primary production was influenced by a combination of tolerance, morphology and life habit traits; however tolerance traits contributed most of variability in macrophyte primary production when all traits were analysed jointly.\r\nThis study also showed the existence of trait clustering as the studied trait categories were not fully independent; strong interlinkages between and within trait categories emerged.\r\nOur study suggests that functional trait analysis captures different aspects of ecosystem functioning and thereby enables assessing primary production of macrophyte communities over geographically distinct areas without extensive taxonomic and environmental data. This could result in a novel framework through which a simplification of the general procedure of production estimations and comparisons across environmental gradients can be achieved.",

          "abstract": "<p>Early administration of effective antimicrobial treatments is critical for the outcome of infections and the prevention of treatment resistance. Antimicrobial resistance testing enables the selection of optimal antibiotic treatments, but current culture-based techniques can take up to 72 hours to generate results. We have developed a novel machine learning approach to predict antimicrobial resistance directly from MALDI-TOF mass spectra profiles of clinical samples. We trained calibrated classifiers on a newly-created publicly available database of mass spectra profiles from clinically most relevant isolates with linked antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes. The dataset combines more than 300,000 mass spectra with more than 750,000 antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from four medical institutions. Validation against a panel of clinically important pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resulting in AUROC values of 0.80, 0.74, and 0.74 respectively, demonstrated the potential of using machine learning to substantially accelerate antimicrobial resistance determination and change of clinical management. Furthermore, a retrospective clinical case study found that implementation of this approach would have resulted in a beneficial change in the clinical treatment in 88% (8/9) of cases. MALDI-TOF mass spectra based machine learning may thus be an important new tool for treatment optimization and antibiotic stewardship.</p>\r\n",

          "abstract": "Recent floristic efforts in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) have made it possible to characterize the broad-scale patterns of fern and lycophyte diversity across this geologically-complex region of western North America. The physiography of the PNW has been developing for over 200 million years, but Pleistocene glaciation-induced migrations and recolonizations have strongly influenced the assembly of the flora. With the high dispersal potential of spores, distribution patterns of pteridophytes may represent habitat suitability more than dispersal constraints. Our objective was to describe the biodiversity of pteridophytes in the PNW, determine the spatial distribution of that biodiversity in terms of phylogenetic diversity, identify centers of regional endemism, explore correlations between biodiversity and environmental variables, and infer influences of past glaciation on the pteridophyte flora. We obtained distribution data, constructed a phylogenetic tree using chloroplast data, and used the Biodiverse software package to estimate and map phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic endemism across the PNW, identifying regions where diversity was higher or lower than expected in comparison to randomization models. Environmental correlates of diversity were identified using principal components analysis with bioclimatic data from WorldClim.org, and we used Maxent to predict habitat suitability for species under past and future climate conditions. We found evidence for the influence of glacial refugia on patterns of pteridophyte diversity, that moisture availability and cold temperatures are strongly correlated with patterns of richness, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic endemism, and infer that topographic complexity may be driving the assembly of the pteridophyte flora indirectly by influencing climate and precipitation patterns.",

          "abstract": "We use three allopatric populations of the stalk-eyed fly Teleopsis dalmanni from Southeast Asia to test two predictions made by the sex chromosome drive hypothesis for Haldane's rule. The first is that modifiers that suppress or enhance drive should evolve rapidly and independently in isolated populations. The second is that drive loci or modifiers should also cause sterility in hybrid males. We tested these predictions by assaying the fertility of 2,066 males derived from backcross experiments involving two pairs of populations and found that the proportion of mated males that fail to produce any offspring ranged from 38-60% among crosses with some males producing strongly female-biased or male-biased sex ratios. After genotyping each male at 25-28 genetic markers we found quantitative trait loci (QTL) that jointly influence male sterility, sperm length and biased progeny sex ratios in each pair of populations, but almost no shared QTL between population crosses. We also discovered that the extant XSR chromosome has no effect on sex ratio or sterility in these backcross males. Whether shared QTL are caused by linkage or pleiotropy requires additional study. Nevertheless, these results indicate the presence of a \"cryptic\" drive system that is currently masked by suppressing elements that are associated with sterility and sperm length within but not between populations and, therefore, must have evolved since the populations became isolated, i.e. in less than 100,000 years. We discuss how genes that influence sperm length may contribute to hybrid sterility.",
