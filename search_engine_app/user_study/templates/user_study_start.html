                    <p class="card-text"> This study consists of one search phase and two tests (one test before the search phase and one post-test after it). Each test asks you different questions about your knowledge on one or more topics - please answer the questions truthfully. 
                    Your payment is not affected by the number of correct or incorrect answers. 
                    Most questions are multiple-choice questions, in the last test we ask you to write a summary about one topic too.
                    <strong>You have to write the summary based on your memory of the knowledge that you learned during the search phase</strong>. </p>
                    
              
                    <p> We have a few important points: </p>
                    <ol type="-">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Only use the web search interface we provide. 
                            Do not switch browser tabsâ€“-after three tab switches we will cancel your participation.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            You can interact with the search results. 
                            A click on a document snippet will open this document in our own document viewer. 
                            <strong> There may be a question regarding the document you are reading. You are required to answer the question based on the document.</strong>
                            Your payment is not affected by the number of correct or incorrect answers. However, we will check the answer quality and cancel your participation if we find meaningless or off-document answers.
                            We know that this document viewer is not perfect, but please stick with it. 
                            
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <p>
                            Keep your searches on the topic and avoid searches on unrelated topics. 
                            For example, if your topic is computer science, we consider searches for tomorrow's weather, the latest news on Brexit, movie reviews of the Avenger movies, as off-topic and will cancel your participation.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>Finally, a reminder before you continue:
                    please read the task description on the right-hand side of the search interface carefully. </p>
